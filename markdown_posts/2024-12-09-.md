Electronicore is a genre that blends Metalcore and Post-Hardcore with various Electronic Dance Music styles, incorporating sequencers, synthesizers, dance beats, and auto-tuned clean singing, often alongside screamed vocals. It draws influences from Trance, Dubstep, and other electronic genres, frequently shifting between heavy and melodic sections, similar to Melodic Metalcore. This genre is closely associated with the "scene" subculture.

The style gained traction in the late 2000s, with notable pioneers and U.S. bands helping popularize it. The early 2010s saw electronicore's rise, with bands from Europe, the U.S., and Japan achieving success. Over the years, elements of electronicore influenced mainstream rock acts, while bands like Electric Callboy brought the genre renewed attention with recent commercial breakthroughs.
