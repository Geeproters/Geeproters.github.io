Here's the opening and ending of another nostalgic show for me, Tonari no Seki kun. Might have watched this when I was around 13.

I'm not a big fan of the opening song itself, but it's got a clever and meta video I like.

This ending was one of the most memorable parts of the show for me for both its music and visuals.
