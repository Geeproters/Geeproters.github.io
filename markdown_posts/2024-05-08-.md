Continuing from the previous rec,

Here's Leonard Cohen's most famous work, Hallelujah. Originally released on his album Various Positions (1984)

Over 4 to 5 years, Cohen is reputed to have written around 80 to as many as 180 draft verses for "Hallelujah"â€”a number affected by the accounting question that he had many versions of the same line. In a writing session in New York's Royalton Hotel, Cohen is famously said to have been reduced to sitting on the floor in his underwear, filling notebooks, banging his head on the floor.


"You Want It Darker," Cohen's 2016 album, is an introspective exploration of mortality, spirituality, humor, and the human experience. It was produced near the end of his life when he was around 82.
