Death industrial is a development of Noise and Industrial music characterized by the creation of densely dark atmospheres with noise-infused textures and production techniques rooted in Power Electronics. The genre emerged from the late 1980s power electronics scene through pioneering experiments by acts Ramleh, Genocide Organ and Mz.412, whose production styles incorporated elements of Dark Ambient by exchanging the abrasive attributes of power electronics for more atmosphere-orientated production; this effect is achieved with low pitched Drones and distorted synth loops, as well as a subdued pace. As in power electronics, vocals are sometimes used in form of harsh, shouted or spoken performances rather than sung.

Here's Caligula, a 2019 album by Lingua Ignota.

Hateful, misanthropic, and dark, but very cinematic. The 4th track is the first on the album to lean hard into noise.
