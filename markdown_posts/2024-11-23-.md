Dixieland, also known as Hot Jazz or New Orleans Jazz, emerged in the 1910s as one of the earliest forms of jazz. Named after the Original Dixieland Jazz Band, among the first to release commercial jazz recordings, this style influenced notable musicians like Louis Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton, and King Oliver.

Rooted in Ragtime and early Blues, Dixieland emphasized harmonic simplicity and improvisation. Unlike later jazz styles like Big Band, where soloists stood out, Dixieland encouraged all instruments to alternate between solo and accompaniment roles. Its signature sound often featured polyphony, with instruments weaving independent melodies that maintained harmonic cohesion.

Dixieland ensembles were typically small, incorporating piano, trumpet, clarinet, and drums. Instruments like the banjo and vibraphone occasionally appeared, while saxophones were rare. As the style gained popularity, it spread beyond New Orleans but declined with the rise of Swing in the 1930s. Though no longer mainstream, Dixieland’s legacy endures, influencing jazz improvisation and popularizing tunes like When the Saints Go Marching In.
