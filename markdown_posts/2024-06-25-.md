I talked a bit about Sade on 693.

Here's a mashup EP between her and MF DOOM from 2016, SADEVILLAIN, by Seanh2k11. Really nice mashup. Everything works together perfectly.

MF DOOM is known to have been a big fan of Helen Folasade Adu (aka Sade), having sampled her works on several of his tracks. Doomsday, for example, is built around a large sample of Sade’s ‘Kiss of Love’.


There's also this mashup one with DOOM and Nujabes that I really like, Metaphorical Villainy, released 2020 by DJ A-OK.

MUCH LOVE, AND THANK YOU FOR LISTENING!! DOOM’s love for Sade is the stuff of legend at this point – just listen to Operation: Doomsday standout ‘Doomsday’, which is built around a large sample of Sade’s ‘Kiss of Love’.
