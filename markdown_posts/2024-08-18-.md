Rage is a subgenre of Trap developed in the early 2020s. It is characterized by dense, buzzing synth work inspired by 2010s Electronic Dance Music, mainly Future Bass, with repetitive chord progressions and melodic, often euphoric synth leads, typically performed in an energetic rap style. The genre also takes cues from the production style of Pi'erre Bourne, whose work with rapper Playboi Carti laid out the foundation for rage's unorthodox and repetitive song structure. This departure from a conventional Hip Hop song structure contributed to rage's distinct "punk ethos."

The genre would solidify itself with the collaboration between Playboi Carti and Working on Dying's F1LTHY on the dissonant Whole Lotta Red. However, it was Trippie Redd's "Miss the Rage" snippet that gained major popularity around the Internet, notably composed by reversing a future bass loop from a Cymatics sample pack. This would lead to the naming of the genre, commonly searched on YouTube as "Rage Beats" or "Rage Type Beat." Rage has been heavily influenced by the SoundCloud scene, specifically artists from subgenres like Plugg/PluggnB, Digicore, and Cloud Rap. Rage has proven to be influential in the trap scene, heavily inspiring the sound of New Jazz.

Its a bit unusual for new HexD and Rage music to get this many listens in such a short time. 

As a reminder, HexD is a genre using heavily bit-crushed vocals, sometimes sped-up and pitched-up, and highly compressed and distorted production, typically made from existing material of other genres.
