The culture of Italy is as rich and varied as its history, leading to a large mosaic of regional Traditional Folk Music encompassing, for example, Canzone napoletana in the region of Naples, and polyphonic Cantu a tenore in the island of Sardinia. 

I spoke about Canzone napoletana on rec 1011.

Cantu a tenore is a style of secular Polyphonic Chant from the Mediterranean island of Sardinia. It is rural-based music that is often accompanied by a traditional dance. A tenore chorus generally consists of four voices: boche (the lead), mesu boche (half voice), cronta (baritone), and bassu (bass). The lead sings a lyrical text, while the chorus follows with nonsense syllables in a distinctive low register, guttural style. 

Here's a song from Tenores di Bitti's 1996 album S'amore 'e mama
