Here's another Wave album. More art-poppy in it's execution. 

Trinity, by Eartheater, from 2019
https://youtu.be/52a4D03dBK0?t=444

Very aquatic-sounding album, which matches the track names. Again, very atmospheric.

Tracks are called:
Prodigal Self
High Tide
Supersoaker
Spill the Milk
Lick My Tears
Pearl Diver
Preservation
Runoff
Fontanel
Solid Liquid Gas

innuendo

the lyrics are kinda funny
