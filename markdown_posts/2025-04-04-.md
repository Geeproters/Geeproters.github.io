Oki Kano (加納 沖, Kanō Oki), known professionally as OKI, is a Japanese musician of mixed Japanese Ainu ancestry. He blends the sound of the tonkori with drums, bass, keyboards, and dub influences.

In 1992, Oki received his first Tonkori—a traditional stringed instrument of the Indigenous Ainu people of Sakhalin. At the time, the tonkori was mostly seen behind glass in museums, with few traditional players left. Driven by curiosity and passion, Oki immersed himself in learning the instrument and soon began crafting his own. In 1996, he released his debut album Kamuy Kor Nupurpe. Not long after, he founded Chikar Studio to support fellow Ainu artists and share their music. To date, Chikar Studio has released over 20 albums, including work by renowned traditional singer Umeko Ando and the all-female vocal group Marewrew.
