冀西南林路行 (Inside the Cable Temple) is a 2020 album by 万能青年旅店 [Omnipotent Youth Society]. 
https://youtu.be/KbTVBt8mLek (short audio corruption from 6:23 to 6:34 but otherwise HQ)

It's a lovely album, mellow and lush. A blend of chamber folk, art rock, prog, and a bit of jazz. Pretty technical at parts.

Dong Yaqian has a great voice

I really like the whole album but track 7 is a standout. The clarinet at 29:18 is so good.
