Rawphoric is a subgenre of Rawstyle that combines its raw harsher kicks with the uplifting melodies of Euphoric Hardstyle. The genre was originated in the 2010s, after raw and euphoric were settled as two counterparts of the Hardstyle scene, and the tracks are on the average tempo of 150 BPM. Artists such as the duo Sub Zero Project and the producer Phuture Noize were prominent to increase the genre's popularity. Although the term "rawphoric" is not always used (being also replaced with other variations like "euphoraw", "melodic rawstyle" and "euphoric rawstyle"), this new wave of hardstyle DJs and producers blurred the line dividing rawstyle and euphoric hardstyle into a more hybrid and atmospheric sound, which also differentiates it from the "gated kicks" of xtra raw.
