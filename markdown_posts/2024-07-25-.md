Attack No. 1 (アタックNo.1, Atakku Nanbā Wan) is a Japanese manga series by Chikako Urano. It became the first televised female sports anime series in the shōjo category. 

The anime is an adaptation of Urano's 1968 volleyball manga serialized in Weekly Margaret Magazine under the same name. Urano was considered one of the founders of shōjo anime. The series was introduced not only to push the older female manga fan base into the anime mainstream, but also capitalizes on the boom of the gold medal Japanese women's volleyball team in the 1964 Olympics. It The show did stand out in an era dominated by shōnen adventures and sci-fi anime, and was well received in the anime-friendly television markets of France, Italy, and Germany.
