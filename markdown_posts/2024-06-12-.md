His work on A Silent Voice almost exclusively uses solo piano, which works great

Very impressive that he's the same guy to compose the darksynth/post-industrial type of EBM you can expect from Devilman

My favorites from him are his more meandering works that use natural or experimental sounding samples. Here's a track from Japan Sinks, for instance.
