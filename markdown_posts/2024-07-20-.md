Samuel Shepherd, known professionally as Floating Points, is a British electronic music producer, DJ, and musician. He is the founder of Pluto Records, co-founder of Eglo Records and leader of a 16-piece group called Floating Points Ensemble.

I mentioned him briefly on rec 1226 for his work on one of my favorite albums, Promises.

Here's his 2019 Progressive Electronic album Crush. I've timestamped on of my favorite tracks, but I found it to be worth listening through the whole thing.

Super lush and complex. Often hypnotic and psychedelic.
