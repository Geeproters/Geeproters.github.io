Briddim is a form of Brostep that emerged in the mid-to-late 2010s. With its name a combination of "brostep" and "riddim", the style incorporates the kick-clap rhythm of Riddim into brostep production, resulting in a distinct off-beat sound. Additionally, the style foregoes riddim's minimal, repetitive and rolling sound, instead sticking to brostep's drop-oriented structures, with distinct intros and buildups, unlike riddim's more traditional progressions. As its roots mostly go back to brostep producers who began to use riddim rhythms, and since it was often called simply riddim (before "briddim" caught on as a term), the sound was often proclaimed as "fake" or inauthentic riddim by riddim fans. Additionally, though the style typically replaces riddim's gritty LFO synth leads with growly brostep sound design, it often has a swampy, "wet" and metallic sound inspired by riddim.
