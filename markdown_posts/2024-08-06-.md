Ranchera 

Ranchera or canci√≥n ranchera ("ranch song‚Äù) is a popular genre of Mexican Music developed in the nationalist theater of the post-1910 revolution period in Mexico. From the 1930s onward, rancheras became an important part of Mexican films, several of which- such as All√° en el Rancho Grande [Over at the Big Ranch]- were built around well-known songs. In the 1930s, the Mexican government actively promoted ranchera, fostering the production of musical films known as comedias rancheras, featuring acclaimed radio personalities such as Jorge Negrete, Pedro Infante and Jos√© Alfredo Jim√©nez.

If rancheras were ever genuinely folk music, they soon became commercial songs performed mostly by urban singers. Professional singers developed an extremely emotional style, one of whose characteristics is a held note at the end of a line, culminating in a "dying fall" that could drop a third or more. Like Corridos, rancheras can be accompanied by different types of instrumental groups, such as bandas sinaloenses, conjuntos Norte√±os, Mariachis, marimba groups, and orquestas t√≠picas.
