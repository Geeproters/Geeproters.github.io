Chazzanut, or cantorial music, is the traditional vocal art of Jewish liturgy, performed by a chazzan (cantor) to lead synagogue prayers through expressive, melodic chanting. Rooted in centuries-old Jewish religious practices, it evolved significantly in Ashkenazi communities, blending traditional prayer modes (nusach) with Western classical and Christian liturgical influences. By the 18th and 19th centuries, professional cantors incorporated operatic and classical techniques, elevating chazzanut as both a sacred and artistic form.

Distinct regional styles shaped the development of cantorial music, particularly between Western and Eastern Ashkenazi traditions. Western cantorial music, influenced by Christian liturgical elements such as choirs and organs, leaned on the classical German nusach (Minhag Ashkenaz). In contrast, Eastern styles retained strong Hasidic influences, characterized by intense emotional expression, melismatic improvisation, and unique vocal techniques like bent pitches and quarter tones. While Western traditions were more standardized and diminished over time due to historical disruptions, Eastern cantorial music remained dynamic, spreading globally through immigration and cultural preservation.

The "golden age" of cantorial music flourished between the two world wars, as prominent cantors like Yossele Rosenblatt and Zavel Kwartin achieved fame for their virtuosic performances. The genre transcended religious settings, with many cantors gaining recognition through concerts and recordings. Today, chazzanut endures in traditional Jewish communities and continues to bridge Jewish liturgical heritage with its rich musical legacy.

It would be a very brave person who would unequivocally state that any one of the four Kussevitsky brothers, Moshe, David, Jacob and Simcha, was the best.  They were all known for individual qualities and, in truth, each was an outstanding Chazan in his own right.

David certainly had a most unusual voice, and was ...
