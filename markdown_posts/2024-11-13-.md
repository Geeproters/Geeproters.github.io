Ashkenazi music represents the diverse musical traditions of the Ashkenazi Jews, a group originally rooted in Central and Eastern Europe. These traditions are closely tied to the community's history, marked by migrations from southern Europe during the Roman Empire to the Rhine region in the Middle Ages, and later to Eastern Europe after expulsions. Despite the displacement of Ashkenazi Jews during the Holocaust and subsequent migrations to the United States and Israel, their music remains a vital connection to their European heritage.

Influenced by the musical traditions of their surrounding regions, Ashkenazi music developed distinct forms compared to other Jewish communities, though overlaps exist, such as with Sephardic and Mizrahi music. A hallmark of Ashkenazi music is Klezmer (see entry 899), a secular genre combining Romanian, Greek, Slavic, Balkan, and Romani influences. Originally used in celebrations like weddings, Klezmer became internationally known after being brought to the U.S. by Eastern European Jewish immigrants. 

Ashkenazi music spans both secular and liturgical genres, often reflecting the cultural and religious practices of the community. Liturgical music, typically performed a cappella, includes cantorial music and nigunim, wordless melodies that originated in Hasidic communities. Secular traditions feature Yiddish folk songs and contemporary interpretations blending Western genres like jazz and pop. While Yiddish was historically central to Ashkenazi music, migrations and the Holocaust shifted the focus to English and Hebrew. Today, labels like Tzadik and Jewish Music Group continue to celebrate and innovate within the Ashkenazi musical tradition.
