I recced Magdalena Bay's sophomore album Imaginal Disk back on 1426. Rececmtly I've had it on repeat almost nonstop on my commute. I'd call it my favorite album of 2024, no doubt.

Here's the duo's debut album, Mercurial World, from 2021

Not quite as strong as Imaginal Disk, but a phenomenal synth/dance pop album nonetheless. One that is lush, melodic, ethereal, and passionate. Memorable choruses, sugary hooks, and a natural flow between tracks that forces me into listening through the whole album.
