Here's another Celtic New Age album, The Mask and Mirror, a 1994 album by Loreena McKennitt, a Canadian singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and composer who writes, records, and performs world music with Celtic and Middle Eastern influences.

Lush and atmospheric album. It's really interesting how the arabic music influences were incorporated with the celtic folk style.
