Jazz-rock is a genre of rock music shaped by jazz, particularly in its structure and instrumentation. Emerging in the late 1960s, it was pioneered by artists like Soft Machine and Frank Zappa, who crafted long, improvisational jams that often featured traditional rock instruments, though not exclusively. Over time, jazz-rock also evolved into more mainstream, pop-influenced styles, as seen in the work of bands like Chicago and Steely Dan, who incorporated jazz-rock elements within a more accessible framework.
