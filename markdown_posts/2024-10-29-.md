From southerncrossflutes.com: 
"The Mayan Temple Flute, also known as the Harmony Flute, is a multi-chambered, multi-keyed flute, that has its origins dating back to between 200BCE and 1200CE. Each chamber can be played as a solo flute, alternating between the left and right, or both chambers together. This creates an immersive, harmonious, and highly resonant sound.

This style of flute originated in the Mayan and Teotihuacan cultures, where it was commonly crafted from clay and played by priests and villagers. It has been adapted into a wooden flute that combines the traditional Mayan dual chambered clay flute, with the totem and slow air chamber from the modern Native American Style Flute."

Here's a performance by Aida Mendoza on a Mayan Temple Flute he created.
