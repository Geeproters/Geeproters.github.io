Man I watched one AZALI release cut piano video and now it's all that's getting recommended to me

Most of the videos of this type from around that time were inspired by AZALI

My love letter to the release cut piano
Enable subtitles for captions!! :)
This might be the best thing I've ever made
If this flops, I'll be like so upset :(((

Piano used in this video: T30-GP by 12bitz (it's free, don't worry)

Upbeat song made with FL Studio 21

Also, sorry if it feels repetitive. I've been kinda lazy to come up with stuff for the past few days

I found a release cut piano
I've been looking for a piano vst that lets me cut the release for sooo long!!
Its my first time ever using a release cut piano, and i'm really proud of this :)
