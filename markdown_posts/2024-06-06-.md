Ekatarina Velika, sometimes referred to as EKV for short, was a Serbian and Yugoslav rock band from Belgrade, being one of the most successful and influential Yugoslav music acts. 

Here's their 1986 album S' vetrom uz lice (With the wind against my face)

Very enjoyable New Wave record.

The sound quality on that Youtube upload isn't great. Best to listen elsewhere if possible.
