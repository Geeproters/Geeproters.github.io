Chuntunqui romántico

Chuntunqui romántico is a vibrant Bolivian genre set in 6/8 meter featuring choral refrains, harmonic progressions, and lyrics exploring the subject of romantic love. It is derived from the original chuntunqui that Chuquisaca musicians traditionally perform at Christmastime.

In the late 1960s, Ernesto Cavour, renowned charango player and member of the folk ensemble Los Jairas, composed an instrumental piece titled "Chuntunqui.”

This led to chuntunqui being incorporated into the neofolklore music of Kjarkas, a prominent ensemble influenced by balada latinoamericana- the post-1960s Latin American iteration of the Bolero tradition. The song "Pequeño amor" became a hit and marked the genre's evolution into a love song with an Andean flair.

The popularity of chuntunqui expanded beyond Bolivia, reaching countries like Peru, Ecuador, and Chile, where it resonated with young audiences. The genre became an emblem of youth identity, blending Andean heritage with the experiences of modern society. By the 1980s, chuntunqui became a Conjunto andino staple for Bolivian bands, as well as for non-Bolivian groups of this variety.

I think I'll end it there for this series on music from the Andes. I've missed a lot of genres, and it wasn't really organized because I wasn't planning for it to go this long.

Anyway, I started at 1208 and ended it at 1223. It was unbroken, so that brings it to 16 recs total. Of these, the ones I'm most likely to continue returning to are Luzmila Carpio's 2003 album The Song of the Earth and Stars (rec 1217)

And also Inti Raymi's 1992 album Traditional Music from the Andes which started this series on rec 1208

I'll also give Fuera de la ciudad, the 1973 album by El Polen, at least one more listen
