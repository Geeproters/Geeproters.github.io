Ghettotech

The term "ghettotech", coined by Disco D in 1998, is a style of Electronic Dance Music that emerged from Detroit in the mid-to-late 1990s, which fuses the syncopation and synthesized sounds of Detroit Techno and Electro with the cut-up samples of Ghetto House and fast rhythms of Miami Bass (typically 145 bpm minimum). Innovators of the genre include DJ Godfather, DJ Assault and Disco D.
