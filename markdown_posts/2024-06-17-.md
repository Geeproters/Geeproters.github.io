I recced a couple of albums by TURQUOISEDEATH back on rec 965. Since then, they've become one of my favorite breakcore producers.

One of the timestamped tracks of Fool's Gold, Don't Look Back, is among my favorite breakcore songs.

In 2022 they also released this single, "hello?"

Maybe it's the use of samples from a few older songs and media that I recognize, but this track has a real nostalgic vibe for me.

It's their most-listened by a pretty wide margin.
