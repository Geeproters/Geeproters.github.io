Trap in Electronic Dance Music (EDM) is characterized by trap hip-hop-influenced syncopated percussion with 808 samples and fast-paced hi-hats. Influences include Dubstep, Wonky, Grime, and other UK Bass trends. In the late 2010s, artists like G Jones and Kai Whiston developed an experimental side of trap, while Skeler pioneered Hardwave. RL Grime remained influential into the 2020s with annual Halloween mixes and his label, Sable Valley Records. The genre's origins trace back to artists like Lunice, Sinjin Hawke, Hudson Mohawke, and Rustie, showing notable interplay between trap and future bass.

The term "trap" was established in 2012, a breakthrough year marked by releases like the "Original Don (Flosstradamus Remix)" and TNGHT EP. Pioneers such as RL Grime, UZ, and Baauer emerged during this time. The genre's popularity surged due to Diplo's label Mad Decent, the viral success of "Harlem Shake," and YouTube channels like Trap City, All Trap Music, and Trap Nation. Early trap was characterized by a dark, minimalistic atmosphere, prominent sub-bass, frequent drops, playful vocal samples, and Dutch House-influenced synths.

Trap evolved into a broader genre with various sub-styles. Yellow Claw's Hardstyle influences led to Hard Trap, pioneered by SAYMYNAME. Carnage's Festival Trap blended Big Room House, while Slander's Heaven Trap fused trap with Festival Progressive House. Branchez and Vanic developed "chill trap," influenced by future bass, Chillstep, and Tropical House.

Trap gained mainstream popularity with producers like DJ Snake and pop crossovers such as "Dark Horse" and "Don't Let Me Down." It became popular in K-Pop with acts like BLACKPINK and influenced Hyperpop. Although rapping is typically absent in EDM trap, crossovers, including Skrillex collaborations, have occurred.

I talked about the 2001 Japanese film All About Lily Chou-Chou back on rec 655. I finally watched the movie a few weeks ago.

A hauntingly beautiful film with a soundtrack to match.
Here's the first song off Kokyu, the album I recced on 655:

I've been listening to it quite a bit recently

Lily Chou-Chou - Arabesque
Opening song off the soundtrack album Breath.


Here's the singer who plays Lily Chou Chou, Salyu, and Cornelius performing Jibun ga Inai from the Ghost in the Shell OST in January of 2024.

Here's the OST version.

I recced this song on 631, but I didn't realize Salyu was the artist behind Lily Chou Chou at that point.

I think the lyrics are pretty poignant. They match the song well:

Mem mem mem mem mem mem mem mem
Mem or ies, mem or ies, mem or ies
Memories, memories, memories, memories, memories
Memories, memories, memories, memories, memories, memoriesmemoriesmemories

Disconnected memories
Flowers (birds), This is the sky
Clouds, grass, the house where I grew up
But even if I look in the photos
I'm not there anywhere
Why am I not there? Why am I not there? (x4)

Disconnected beautiful memories
Right (left), where am I?
Buildings, roads, but even if I
walk among the crowds
I'm not there anywhere
The world, the world (x4)

It continues (simply)
It is vast (the sky)
They shine (green)
The mountains and (the ocean)
The wind (from the past)
to the future (it blows)
And I am (left)
behind (all alone)

My se lf, my se lf, my se lf
My self, my self, my self, my self, my self
Myself, myself, myself, myself, myself, myself, myself, myself
myselfmyselfmyselfmyselfmyselfmyselfmyselfmyselfmyselfmyself
Why am I not there? Why am I not there? (x4)

Fun factoid: Salyu is the singer from the 2001 Shunji Iwai film, "All About Lily Chou-Chou".
