Acholitronix was founded in the early 2000s by Otim Alpha and Leo PaLayeng, in an attempt to replace the expensive larakaraka ensembles present at traditional Acholi weddings. The two collaborated to create an electronic-inspired version of the larakaraka dance music, which soon extended to electronic reinterpretations of other folk and ceremonial songs of the Acholi people, with a heavy emphasis on danceable rhythms and traditional motifs and sounds. Many traditional instruments are used, such as the nanga harp, which is considered essential to Acholi Music, as well as traditional lyrics and vocal performances. This is layered over Electronic Dance Music inspired instrumentation, based on traditional Acholi rhythms, typically played between 110 and 170 BPM. The music has since gained mainstream appeal not only in Acholiland, but in Uganda and other East African countries as well, being especially prominent in the club scene of these countries.
