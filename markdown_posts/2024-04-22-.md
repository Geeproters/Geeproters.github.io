Caporal 

Caporal is a Bolivian neofolkloric dance music known for its double beat bass drum pattern, emerging in the latter half of the twentieth century.

Its roots lie in an Andean criollo-mestizo parade form that satirizes Afro-Bolivian expressive practices, known variably in Bolivia as tundiqui, tuntuna, and negritos. In 1969, Los Jairas adapted it to the Conjunto andino style, becoming the first group to do so with "San Benito," featured on the 1969 LP Bolivia Con Los Jairas. Chile’s Inti-Illimani incorporated it into their repertoire after hearing it in La Paz in 1970. Concurrently, Los Payas popularized the genre in Bolivia during the 1970s, preferring the term "tuntuna."

In the 1980s, a new version, danza de los caporales, gained popularity in Bolivian entrada scenes, featuring flashier dance steps and attire. The musical element was often termed saya or saya caporal, frustrating Afro-Bolivians due to its lack of resemblance to Afro-Bolivian Saya.

Los Kjarkas (who I also featured on rec 1212) introduced caporal with "Llorando se fue" on their 1982 album Canto a la mujer de mi pueblo. Despite recording seven albums between 1983 and 1990, they produced only three additional caporales until the Lambada craze of 1989. This prompted greater attention to caporal, making it a staple genre for Los Kjarkas and other conjuntos andinos.

In 1984, a Peruvian group, Cuarteto Continental, produced the first upbeat version of the song, speeding up the rhythm. The rights were then purchased by Brazilian singer Marcia Ferreira, who sped up the song even more, incorporating the accordion used on the Cuarteto track, and singing it in Portuguese as "Chorando Se Foi". This was then covered by the French-Brazilian band Kaoma, whose 1989 version titled "Lambada" sold 15 million copies around the world. The producers were then sued successfully by Los Kjarkas when it was found that they didn't properly credit nor get permission to publish.

Throughout the 1990s, Thai, Hindi, and Cantonese covers of the songs were released by various artists, and in January 2011, Puerto Rican artist Don Omar released a fast-paced, Reggaeton song, "Taboo" which samples the Kaoma and Ferreira versions in the chorus and the bridge. One month later, Jennifer Lopez's "On The Floor" (ft. Pitbull) was released, incorporating the sample in the hook and the song's intro. "On The Floor" went on to sell 11 million records worldwide.
