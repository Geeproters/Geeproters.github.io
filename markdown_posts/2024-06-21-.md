Political hip hop is a style of Hip Hop that developed in the 1980s. Grandmaster Flash & The Furious Five released the first well-known Conscious Hip Hop single in 1982 called "The Message", which encouraged numerous hip hop artists to address social and political subjects. In 1988, Boogie Down Productions released the Malcolm X-inspired By All Means Necessary, the first full-length political hip hop album, dealing with topics of police corruption and the government's involvement in drug crime. Further influential releases included Public Enemy's It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back, which took a black nationalist stance, and N.W.A's "Fuck tha Police" which dealt with police brutality and racial profiling.

The musical style refers to artists who have overt political affiliations and agendas, covering all ideological stripes. As previously mentioned, black nationalist viewpoints like those of Public Enemy and Ice Cube were common in the late 80s and early 90s, while in the 2000s a wave of socialist artists like Dead Prez and Immortal Technique achieved critical recognition. In 2015, Kendrick Lamar would release the album To Pimp a Butterfly, which contained a number of political songs such as "Alright", which became a soundtrack to the Black Lives Matter movement and was chanted at protests. Run the Jewels also achieved success around the same time, with their self-described "incendiary political rhetoric" making critical and commercial waves. In the late 2010s and early 2020s, conservative hip hop began to achieve notoriety, with releases by artists such as Tom MacDonald and Forgiato Blow frequently being discussed in mainstream media and online circles.
