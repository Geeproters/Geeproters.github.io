Marinera

Marinera is the name of a coastal dance, as well as it's musical component, which is often considered the national dance of Peru.

With different origin theories spawning from Peruvian, African, and Spanish proposals, marinera's true conception is undetermined. Some specialists agree that it originated from the ancient musical style and dance of the Viceroyalty of Peru, zamacueca.

Different schools and styles of marineras exist, some of them being marinera norteña (marinera from the north), marinera limeña (marinera from Lima), and marinera serrana (marinera from the highlands).

Regardless of style, the common musical accompaniment of marineras is traditionally made of a group of 4 guitars and the cajón. It is typical for two of the guitar players to also play the role of singers.
