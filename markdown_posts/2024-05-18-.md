Beat bolha (“bubble beat” in Portuguese) is a style of Funk brasileiro defined by its squeaky wisps and chopped bubbling noises, usually played around 130 to 170 BPM. The genre grew out as a fairly known microgenre in Rio de Janeiro's Baixada Fluminense in the late-2010s using bubbling loops, adapting the late Funk carioca trademarks to minimal and Electronic-led tendencies, as on DJ MERINHO and DJ CARETA RLK's YouTube sets. The sound would continue to evolve in the early-2020s with the popularization of Funk 150 bpm in Rio de Janeiro's funk scene, mainly pushed by DJ Ramon Sucesso's frenetic and unpredictable skills with the MIDI controller in mini-sets on fridays, known as Sexta dos crias, that went viral online as a meme during the 2020's pandemic.

The hybridization with funk 150 bpm and other Electronic Dance Music, often referred as tambor bolha, was the turning point for the genre’s development and popularity peak, adding a hyperactive and rawer sound that later would explore even harsher and distorted sampling with turntable scratches, borrowing some Beat bruxaria manipulation techniques. Despite its name, the sonic pallet would cross over diverse sampling, within the modern montagem (mixing in Portuguese) format (MTG acronym), in which the DJ is the focus instead of the MC, while merging trends from other Southeastern Brazilian states, including São Paulo's Funk mandelão, Minas Gerais' Funk de BH and Espírito Santo's Beat fino.
