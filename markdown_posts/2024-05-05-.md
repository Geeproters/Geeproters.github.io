Lullatone is a Japanese musical duo based in Nagoya, whose music is characterized by an innocent, childlike quality and lo-fi sounds. The group refers to their style of music as "pajama-pop", and can be described as Indietronica. 

Thinking About Thursdays was a project where Lullatone would write and release a song each Thursday of the year. 

Their own description: "Imagined as a type of instrumental audio journal, the album finds the duo traveling around the world - writing songs on airplanes to Korea, giving bad Valentine's Day presents, giving up on other New Year's resolutions, and catching the cherry blossoms back in Japan all through their optimistic outlook and sense of melody."

I'd recommend listening to this somewhere else other than YouTube to be able to see the track titles.

The quality of each track is a little inconsistent, as can be expected from a project of this nature. Still, it's an interesting project with some fun ideas.
