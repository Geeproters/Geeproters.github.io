Norteño 

Norteño (from a Spanish word for 'northern') is a more traditional, rural version of Tejano Music. The most typical instruments in this genre are accordion, the bajo sexto (a baritone-range twelve-string guitar), classical guitars, bass, drums, one or two expressive vocalists, and, especially in Chihuahua and Zacatecas, saxophones.
