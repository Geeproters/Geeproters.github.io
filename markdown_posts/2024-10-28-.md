Stomp and holler, a genre of Contemporary Folk that gained mainstream popularity in the 2010s, is defined by strong stomping rhythms, shouted vocal hooks, and a focus on audience participation. Often featuring simple structures, stomp and holler songs are crafted to be catchy and encourage people to join in, with driving beats and repetitive, anthemic choruses designed for stomping and singing along. Influences from Indie Folk are most prevalent, blending its melodic qualities with rustic Americana instrumentation, Gospel and Blues-inspired vocals, and Pop Rock polish. Structurally, stomp and holler has been compared to Alternative Rock due to its dynamic shifts between softer verses and explosive choruses, though it notably favors a polished, commercial production over the raw feel of other indie folk music.

The genre name "stomp and holler" was popularized around 2017 by Spotify’s playlists, though similar sounds had been loosely categorized as “stomp clap” prior, with examples like The Lumineers, Mumford & Sons, Of Monsters and Men, and Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros. While less popular than at its peak, the genre has resurfaced with Noah Kahan’s recent success, which has brought renewed attention. Stomp and holler also shares elements with other 2010s pop rock, as seen in the work of Imagine Dragons, Bastille, and fun., with their emphasis on bold song dynamics and rhythmic stomping.
