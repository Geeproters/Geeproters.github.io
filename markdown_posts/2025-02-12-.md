One more Celtic New Age album.

Ommadawn, a 1975 album by Mike Oldfield.

This album also leans into a prog rock style. It maintains a lush, ethereal quality with pastoral Celtic influences, but also carries a more epic or triumphant feel. Thereâ€™s  some medieval atmosphere created throughout. In the second half, the album becomes more intense and energetic.
