Tearout is also a subgenre of Brostep that is notable for its exaggeratedly heavy and blown out sound. Primarily emerging from Deathstep, tearout shares elements such as percussive "machine gun" FM basslines, heavy drums, "screechy" sound design, and distorted sub-basses. Tearout often uses clipping above 0dB as an integral part of its sound design, giving it a distorted, "blown out" sound. Tearout is differentiated from deathstep by its chaotic feel and more consistent, and denser flow, drawn from brostep.

Tearout derives its name from the earlier Dubstep subgenre also known as Tearout, described on the previous rec, though the two have little musical or cultural relation. Tearout emerged in the early-2010s but was popularized in the mid-2010s with artists such as MARAUDA, SVDDEN DEATH, and PhaseOne, finding early prominence on major brostep labels such as Never Say Die, Black Label, and Marauda's Malignant Music. With time, the genre developed a heavy overlap with Briddim, adopting its repetitive basslines and off-kilter feel. The genre is still prominently featured on labels such as Disciple Recordings and has been adopted by major brostep producers such as MUST DIE! and Excision.
