Here's a track off Pharoah Sanders' 1977 album Pharoah.

Uplifting Spiritual Jazz 

After leaving the Impulse! label, Pharoah Sanders struggled to find a new label and released this album through India Navigation. The recording process was difficult, with some tracks recorded in a cramped home studio with unfamiliar musicians, leading to his long-standing dissatisfaction with the album. While the production is uneven, Harvest Time is a wonderful 20-minute piece of spiritual jazz, blending saxophone, harmonium, bass, and percussion into rich hypnosis. Initially available only through bootlegs, the album was later given a proper reissue under Sandersâ€™ supervision.
