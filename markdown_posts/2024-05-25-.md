Emerging in the Southeast Region of Brazil in the 2010s, Arrocha funk developed in parallel to the Northeast Region's Brega funk. Contrasting the glossy and wonky sound of the latter, arrocha funk features slow and gritty Reggaetón-like drums with an emphasis on brass sections influenced by Arrocha.

The genre was pioneered in Rio de Janeiro by DJ Rennan da Penha, who produced “Arrocha da Penha” by MC Flavinho based on a bass sample and an arrocha drumbeat. The song quickly became a hit, and other artists such as DJ Guuga and MC Nando DK started to expand and spread the sound, “Troféu do ano” bringing national popularity to the genre.

By 2018, brega funk was rising in popularity and the mix of both genres started to become more common. For example, “Envolvimento” by MC Loma e as Gêmeas Lacração became a viral hit and later on “Tudo ok” by Thiaguinho MT topped the Brazilian streaming charts in 2020. As they became popular, both terms started being used interchangeably to refer to any Funk brasileiro and Brega fusion, but their sounds remained distinct.
