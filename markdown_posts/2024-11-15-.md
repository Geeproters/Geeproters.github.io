Shir Hama'alot, a collection of Psalms (including Psalms 126), is traditionally sung in Ashkenazi Jewish communities before Birkat Hamazon (Grace After Meals) on Shabbat, festivals, and other joyous occasions, such as weddings.

Before "Hatikvah" became Israel‚Äôs national anthem, Shir Hama'alot was a serious contender due to its themes of national renewal and hope.

Here's a full translation (New International Version):
When the Lord restored the fortunes of Zion,
we were like those who dreamed.
Our mouths were filled with laughter,
our tongues with songs of joy.
Then it was said among the nations,
‚ÄúThe Lord has done great things for them.‚Äù
The Lord has done great things for us,
and we are filled with joy.
Restore our fortunes, Lord,
like streams in the Negev.
Those who sow with tears
will reap with songs of joy.
Those who go out weeping,
carrying seed to sow,
will return with songs of joy,
carrying sheaves with them.


The work won publicity thanks to its rendition by Josef "Yossele" Rosenblatt (May 9, 1882 ‚Äì June 19, 1933) , who was a relative of Pinchas Minkowsky (1859-1924) of Odessa. Both were important Ashkenazi chazzans and composers, Yossele Rosenblatt was regarded as the greatest cantor of his time.

Shir Hamaalot
As an Israeli who immigrated to America I especially love the holiday of Thanksgiving.
Why? Because it's about giving thanks to all the blessings in our lives, it has agriculture roots as the harvest holiday, and then, of course, it's all about food...
These sentiments in relation to my upbringing in Israel, are beautifully described in Shir HaM...
