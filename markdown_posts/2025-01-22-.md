The Concerto Project is a collection of concerti written by Philip Glass. The series was begun in 2000 and contains eight works, the most famous of which is probably the Concerto for Cello and Orchestra. Some of the concerti in the volumes were written before the commencement of the project and were categorized into the series. 

There are four volumes of the Project:

1.The Concerto Project Vol. I, containing the Cello Concerto and the Concerto Fantasy for Two Timpanists and Orchestra.
2. The Concerto Project Vol. II, containing the Piano Concerto No. 2: After Lewis and Clark, and the Concerto for Harpsichord and Orchestra.
3. The Concerto Project Vol. III, containing the Concerto Grosso and the Concerto for Saxophone Quartet and Orchestra.
4. The Concerto Project Vol. IV, containing the Double Concerto for Violin, Cello and Orchestra and the Tirol Concerto for Piano and Orchestra (also known simply as Piano Concerto No. 1).
