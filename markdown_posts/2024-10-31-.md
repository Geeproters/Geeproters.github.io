Comfy Synth is an emergent subgenre of Dungeon Synth of the 2020s, characterized by nostalgic, sentimental, and childlike atmospheres that often lend it an amateur quality. With influences from New Age music, it typically features calm, peaceful, or soothing sounds, frequently tinged with melancholy and bittersweet tones. Comfy Synth recordings are often low-fidelity and hazy, embracing minimalist, looping synth patterns and gentle melodies that evoke feelings of simplicity and personal exploration.

This genre’s aesthetic is innocent, sometimes surreal, and often supported by visuals that include cozy imagery: animals, treehouses, fireplaces, donut shops, seaside cottages, and fairy villages. Artists like Grandma's Cottage, Tiny Mouse, The Friendly Moon, and Childhood Memories embody these themes, which often blend real and imagined memories, creating a nostalgic atmosphere that borders on romanticism.


Here's With Dreams of Hereafter, a 2023 album by Hole Dweller.

This artist was essential to the genre's development, with their 2019 release Flies the Coop combining lo-fi production, J.R.R. Tolkien's lore, and a pastoral serenity similar to Chronicles of Jest and Fief.
