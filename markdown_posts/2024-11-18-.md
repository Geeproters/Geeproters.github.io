Post-grunge is a genre that evolved from grunge, combining its gritty guitar tones and themes with a more polished, melodic, and hook-driven approach. Unlike grunge's raw underground roots, post-grunge often embraces pop rock and arena rock conventions, featuring standard verse-chorus structures and moderate pacing. Vocally, it is marked by the "yarling" style popularized by Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam, along with raspy and more traditional singing. Acoustic elements sometimes accompany electric instrumentation, especially in ballads. Lyrically, it mirrors grunge's angsty and vulnerable themes, exploring similar struggles.

Emerging as grunge waned, early post-grunge acts like Bush, Live, and Foo Fighters (led by ex-Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl) defined its first wave, alongside artists like Candlebox, Alanis Morissette, and Everclear. The genre became a rock-radio staple but faced criticism, often labeled as "butt rock." In the 2000s, a second wave, including Nickelback, Creed, and Three Days Grace, leaned toward hard rock and alternative metal influences. Despite growing mainstream success, post-grunge received mixed reviews and saw a decline in the 2010s as rock's popularity faded. However, it continues to influence modern artists like Hardy and Mammoth WVH.
