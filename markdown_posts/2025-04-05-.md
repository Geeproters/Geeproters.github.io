Umeko Ando was an Ainu singer and mukkuri player (a plucked idiophone similar to a Jew's harp). Her participation in Oki Kano's second album Hankapuy, helped her gain recognition.

Here's a track from her 2001 debut album, Ihunke

Upopo are the everyday songs of the Ainu people, distinct from the more sacred Yukar epic chants. While not overtly ceremonial, Upopo still carry spiritual undertones—they might be sung to ward off evil spirits or as brief prayers during daily tasks. These songs are typically short, spontaneous, and closely tied to specific activities, with their rhythms often mirroring the motions of the work being done. Performed in a polyrhythmic style, Upopo stand apart from Yukar in another key way: they allow instrumental accompaniment. Though often sung a cappella, they can also be accompanied by traditional instruments like the mukkuri (a mouth harp), the tonkori (a plucked zither), or the kacho (a frame drum).
