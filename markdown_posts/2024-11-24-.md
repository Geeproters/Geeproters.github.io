New Orleans R&B stands out from other R&B styles due to its unique rhythmic complexity, influenced by the "second line" tradition of Mardi Gras parades and jazz funerals. This rhythmic element, also found in Dixieland and New Orleans Brass Band music, is a defining feature of the genre. Additionally, New Orleans R&B places greater emphasis on piano and horns than typical R&B.

Pioneering artists like Fats Domino and Lloyd Price in the early 1950s played a key role in shaping the genre and its contribution to the birth of Rock & Roll. The large horn sections and regional ties also made New Orleans R&B an original influence on Ska.

By the 1960s and 1970s, artists such as Irma Thomas and The Meters expanded the genre toward Soul and Funk, shifting focus away from piano and horns. Meanwhile, musicians like Professor Longhair preserved the traditional New Orleans R&B sound, blending it with other local styles like New Orleans Blues.
