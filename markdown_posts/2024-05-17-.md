The Apothecary Diaries was my second favorite anime of last year, after Frieren. This was majorly due to it's soundtrack, composed by Alisa Okehazama (known for JJK), Satoru Kōsaki (known for Beastars) and Kevin Penkin (my favorite soundtrack composer who I've already talked about like 10 times on here)

No idea who decided to put these three together, but it worked out perfectly.

My favorites from the OST did end up being by Kevin Penkin, unsuprisingly, but all of them did a great job.

Here are some of my favorites from just Penkin:

It's his first time using traditional chinese instruments in one of his soundtracks to this extent.

The next rew recs will be on Funk Brasileiro

Funk brasileiro, known primarily as "funk" in Brazil, is a Hip Hop-influenced music genre originating from Rio de Janeiro's shanty towns (also known as favelas). Originally rooted in Electro and Miami Bass, Funk carioca developed into a distinctive style and has since established itself as one of the most popular music genres among Brazil's lower-class youths.

Since the 1970s, dance parties known as bailes funk were held in Rio de Janeiro by DJs like Big Boy & Ademir Lemos and sound teams such as Furacão 2000 and Cashbox, usually playing US Funk and Soul music. By the 1980s, with the decline of funk, those parties began playing more electro and hip hop-based music, especially Miami bass. Eventually, Brazilian DJs started making their own Portuguese versions of Miami bass songs, with D.J. Marlboro apresenta Funk Brasil and Equipe Super Quente being the first releases in that style. In 1990 MC Batata's "Feira de Acarí / Conselho" became the first national funk hit in Brazil.
