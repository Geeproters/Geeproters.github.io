Stanley Clarke is an American bassist, composer and founding member of Return to Forever (see entry 485), one of the first jazz fusion bands. Clarke gave the bass guitar a prominence it lacked in jazz-related music. He is the first jazz-fusion bassist to headline tours, sell out shows worldwide and have recordings reach gold status.

Here's Stanley Clarke's 1974 self-titled Jazz-Funk/Fusion album
