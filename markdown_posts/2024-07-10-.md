Algorave is a genre of dancefloor-oriented music that is typically produced live via algorithms. It is often performed at live dance events—known as algoraves—wherein performers 'livecode' to produce music in front of an audience. Using specialized software, which is often open-source, they generate and adjust their music live using programming language. It is common for performers to project their computer screen while livecoding, allowing the audience to view the alterations of code in real-time. Sonically, algorave is characterised by generative and unpredictable drum and synth patterns. Artists tend to avoid the repeated phrases that commonly characterise other forms of Electronic Dance Music. It is not uncommon for unintended errors to occur in the coding process, meaning that the music can deviate from even the artist's intentions with surprising results.

The genre was first given its name by Alex McLean in 2012. It draws on previously existing movements such as academic 'computer music' and the broader 'livecoding' movement, the latter of which can be traced back to Julian Rohrhuber in 2004. Though the term is primarily applied to recordings of live events, there are nonetheless many artists who use the term to describe work in traditional commercial formats. Since 2012, algorave events have been held with increasing frequency around the world. Labels such as Superpang, CO-DEPENDENT and FLUF were established from 2016-2020 and began to release many recordings of live performances as well as previously unheard music.
