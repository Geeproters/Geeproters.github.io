On 967 I posted a song by Microphones, an American indie folk, indie rock, and experimental project from Olympia, Washington, fronted by Phil Elverum. The project was founded in 1996 and ended in 2003. 

The group had a revival in 2020, during which the album "Microphones in 2020" was released, technically one 44 minute song.

The album reflects on memory, identity, and the passage of time. It features Elverum’s signature introspective lyrics and minimalist, repetitive instrumentation, blending elements of folk and ambient music. It serves as a meditation and reflection on his artistic journey and personal experiences. It's a powerful, existential album.

The video is striking too. At 36:50 it lingers on a photo of Geneviève Castrée while Phil stops singing. Geneviève Castrée was a Canadian cartoonist, illustrator, and musician. She met Elverum in 2003, and they married the following year. In 2015, they had a child, but shortly after, she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and passed away in 2016.
