Michael Thomas Volpe, known professionally as Clams Casino, is an American record producer and songwriter from Nutley, New Jersey. Volpe is known for his work in production for several cloud rap artists in the early 2010s.

I used to listen to his instrumentals a lot back in highschool, maybe even back into late elementary school. 

On my 15th music daily I posted a mashup of one of his songs with a song by Death Grips, but that was a long while after I had learned about the two. At this point I'm not sure who I started listening to first.

Here are three of his instrumentals. I'm not sure when the official releases for these came out, but the soundcloud releases were generally around 2009-2012

An official release called Instrumental Relics came out in 2020 compiling these with some other tracks. They really hold up. Very nostalgic music for me.

You can tell that I'm God and I'm the Devil mirror each other in sound a bit by using the same samples.

There's also Human, which is less obviously musically tied to the other two but the title makes it seem thematically linked
