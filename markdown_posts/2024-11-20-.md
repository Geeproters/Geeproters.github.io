Zydeco is an uptempo dance music that mixes the traditional Black Creole folk and French Canadian derived Cajun Music styles of southwest Louisiana with the sounds of early African American Rhythm & Blues, Blues, Jazz, and Gospel performers. The first recordings were in the late 1920s, but the style gained popularity in the 1950s with Clifton Chenier and Boozoo Chavis.

As in Cajun music, the dominant instrument is the accordion, but zydeco often adds bass guitar, horns, and keyboards to the mix, and typically features heavy syncopation. By the 1940s, the use of rub-boards (aka "washboards" or "frottoirs") had become a popular part of the zydeco sound and the instrument is ubiquitous in modern zydeco bands. 

Here's a 1976 track from Clifton Chenier's 1976 album Bogalusa Boogie
