Britpop

Britpop, a branch of Alternative Rock, emerged in the UK in the early 1990s as a response to both American Grunge's angst and the dreamy, noisy Shoegaze style. It brought back a more traditional Rock structure, blending guitar-driven melodies and pop-friendly hooks with influences from 1960s British acts like The Beatles and The Kinks, 1970s Glam and Punk Rock, and 1980s Jangle Pop. Common features included reverbed lead guitars, acoustic strumming, simple chords, string arrangements, and singalong melodies. Unlike the Baggy scene of the late '80s, Britpop avoided dance rhythms, instead highlighting British working- and middle-class life in its lyrics and image, limiting its appeal in the U.S.

Key bands like Oasis, Blur, Pulp, Suede, and Supergrass propelled Britpop’s mid-'90s success. However, the genre declined after 1997 due to Oasis's poorly received Be Here Now and Blur's shift away from Britpop. The spotlight turned to acts like Radiohead and The Verve, leading to the rise of Post-Britpop bands such as Coldplay and Travis, who softened the style and adopted less British-centric themes.
