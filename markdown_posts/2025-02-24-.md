Zeitoper was a brief but influential opera movement in Weimar Germany, emerging as part of the broader Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity) artistic movement. These operas, much like opera buffa, featured satirical storylines set in contemporary society but were composed with accessibility in mind. They often incorporated modern technology—such as airplanes, telephones, and elevators—along with references to popular music of the era, including jazz.

As the Nazi party gained power, the movement faced increasing opposition, leading to its decline by the end of the Weimar Republic. Notable composers associated with Zeitoper include Ernst Krenek, Paul Hindemith, and Kurt Weill. The American composer George Antheil also engaged with the style, as seen in his opera Transatlantic, reflecting its international influence.

Here's Supply & Demand, a 1986 album of songs by  Bertolt Brecht, Kurt Weill & Hanns Eisler. The singer is Dagmar Krause.
