Porn groove is a music genre most famously associated with the soundtracks of pornographic films from the 1970s. Its purpose was to sonically mirror the rhythm, mood, and eroticism of the on-screen action, often compensating for the lack of dialogue or diegetic sound.

The signature element of porn groove is the use of electric guitar with a wah-wah pedal, delivering a sleazy, expressive lead melody. Supporting elements typically include funk-inspired slapped bass, minimalist drum kits with prominent rimshots, and a loose, improvisational feel.

Many of these films were shot on Super 8mm film, a format widely used from the late 1960s to early 1980s for low-budget and amateur productions. While Super 8mm could technically support sound, the cost and complexity of sound film and synchronized editing kept most productions silent - especially short loops intended for peep shows. As a result, the soundtrack became essential, not just for mood but for narrative, leading to the creation of these richly textured, groove-heavy instrumentals.
