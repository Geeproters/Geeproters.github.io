Wave emerged in the mid-2010s as a dark, melancholic style of electronic music, blending Cloud Rap’s dreamy atmospheres with more intense, sinister beats. It incorporates rhythms from Trap, Dubstep, Grime, and UK Bass, often featuring heavy sub-bass, footwork-style drum programming, and distorted synth leads. The genre is mostly instrumental, with dense sci-fi soundscapes and heavily processed vocal samples.

Wave gained popularity through online platforms like SoundCloud and YouTube, spreading from London to the US and Canada. Collectives and independent labels played a key role in its growth, fostering the genre’s underground appeal and futuristic aesthetics.
