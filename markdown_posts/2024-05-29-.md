Broadcast were an English band formed in Birmingham in 1995 by Trish Keenan and James Cargill. Their musical style blended elements of 1960s psychedelia with early electronic music and samples from esoteric sources; it earned the band a cult following.

Keenan died unexpectedly in January 2011 of pneumonia, shortly after she had contracted swine flu while completing a tour of Australia with Broadcast.

Spell Blanket: Collected Demos 2006-2009 was recorded in 2006 - 2009 but it was released in May of 2024.

The album is a collection of 36 tracks that represent the groundwork for their would-be fifth album. Despite the songs being demos, James Cargill’s sequencing creates a cohesive album. The tracks range from playful folk melodies to hazy shoegaze-esque demos. "Spell Blanket" is an exercise in imagination, encouraging listeners to fill in the gaps and appreciate its unfinished yet poignant form.
