Stutter house is a House subgenre that emerged in the early 2020s, mainly from contemporary Progressive House and Melodic House, as well as other 2010s Deep House offshoots like Future House and Tropical House. It is primarily characterized by the distinctive, tremolo chopping of vocal samples and pads, creating a 'stuttering' gated effect reminiscent of the 'trancegate' effect commonly found in Trance music. The genre also bears significant influences from Future Garage, evident in its shuffling, bright percussion, and the use of warm synths and vocal chops, contributing to its emotional atmosphere. Stutter house usually has a tempo around 125 bpm, though certain later tracks explored higher tempos and harder beats, intersecting with Euro-Trance and hypertechno which also rose in popularity in the 2020s. Elements of stutter house can also be found in certain UK Garage and Progressive Breaks tracks of that time.

The term was coined by curator Steve Cardigan, whose playlist of similar tracks garnered significant attention, leading to its adoption on various music and social media platforms. Fred again.. is considered to be a pioneer, with his breakout track "Marea (We’ve Lost Dancing)" in particular achieving big success and popularizing the sound that would become known as stutter house. 

Here's that track, from 2021

Other notable contributors to the genre's development include BUNT. and Lavern. As stutter house gained momentum, various established artists released songs in the genre, such as ODESZA's "The Last Goodbye," Swedish House Mafia's "Ray of Solar," and The Chainsmokers' "The Fall."
