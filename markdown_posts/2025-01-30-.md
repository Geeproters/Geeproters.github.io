Moondog’s 1969 self-titled album is a unique fusion of classical, jazz, and minimalist influences, marked by his unconventional approach to rhythm, which he called "snaketime." Blind since the age of 16, Louis Thomas Hardin developed a distinctive musical style that rejected standard 4/4 timing in favor of complex, flowing patterns. Tracks such as Lament I, ‘Bird’s Lament’ and Stamping Ground highlight his intricate percussion and bold brass arrangements.  

Deeply influenced by Native American rhythms, which he first encountered at an Arapaho sundance, Moondog incorporated unusual time signatures and self-invented instruments like the "Trimba." Though often associated with street performance—earning the nickname "The Viking of 6th Avenue" due to his homemade Viking attire—he maintained relationships with composers such as Philip Glass and influenced the minimalist movement.  

The album, entirely instrumental except for a few spoken-word moments, reflects his ability to merge structured counterpoint with a free-flowing, organic quality. Though initially an outsider, Moondog’s work has since been recognized for its lasting impact on both classical and experimental music.
