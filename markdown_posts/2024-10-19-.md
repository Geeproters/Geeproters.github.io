Rockabilly 

Rockabilly started in the mid-50s at the dawn of Rock & Roll with the influential recordings Elvis Presley made for Sun Records. Originally it was Country musicians playing their own version of uptempo Rhythm & Blues music, resulting in this new style. It usually features driving guitars, frantic vocals and slap-back echo in the bass. Rockabilly still has a big following with new artists emerging every year. 

Here's a track from Johnny Burnette and the Rock 'n Roll Trio, released 1956

Johnny Burnette & the Rock 'n Roll Trio : Honey Hush
From the 1956 debut Coral album, more spontaneous, reckless and dangerous than anything ever recorded by Elvis after his Sun Studios releases.
