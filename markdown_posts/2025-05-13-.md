Melodic metalcore is a subgenre of Metalcore which originated in the late 1990s when some metalcore bands began to infuse elements of Melodic Death Metal into their sound to create a more metallic and melodic style.

The genre was pioneered in the late 1990s by bands such as Shadows Fall, and Undying. These bands combined the metalcore style of the time with various elements of melodic death metal including melodic riffing, blast beats, and melodeath-style screams and growls. This style gained mainstream popularity through the success of Killswitch Engage, paving the way for bands such as Atreyu, As I Lay Dying, God Forbid, and Avenged Sevenfold in the early 2000s. As the decade progressed, melodic metalcore continued to be popular, with bands such as All That Remains, Trivium, and Bullet for My Valentine bringing a sound prioritizing melody even more to the genre.

Melodic metalcoreâ€™s popularity waned in the late 2000s as the mainstream metalcore audience pivoted towards other styles. Some newer bands, such as Miss May I and Parkway Drive, found success in the genre, but many bands transitioned into different styles, with many older melodic metalcore bands embracing Heavy Metal and Alternative Metal, and many newer melodic metalcore bands transitioning back to regular metalcore.
