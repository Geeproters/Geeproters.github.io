Harawi or arawi is one of the oldest surviving genres of Indigenous Andean Music. It is a strictly monophonic style of sung poetry performed by women known as harawiq whose vocals are particularly nasal and high-pitched. Each song consists a repeating musical phrase with prominent glissandi and melismata. Themes are very emotional, often including unrequited love and death, which explains the profound and soulful tone of the music. During pre-Columbian times, the genre was present in most Inca rituals and ceremonies, but after the Spanish colonization its popularity began to decline. By the 19th century, the genre was already eclipsed by its mestizo derivation, Yaraví, a popular genre that includes prominent aspects of Hispanic American Music. Nonetheless, the genre continues to have some influence on contemporary musicians as exemplified by Olivier Messiaen's 1945 classical work Harawi. Furthermore, some artists continue to create harawi music to this day.
