Piedmont Blues 

Piedmont blues is a Country Blues style that originated in the southern Appalachian foothills of Virginia, the Carolinas, and upper Georgia. It also flourished during the first Great Migration (1910-40) in the Northeast, particularly in Washington, D.C., and Maryland. This genre is distinguished by a more melodic finger-picking guitar style compared to Delta Blues or Acoustic Texas Blues. It features syncopated rhythms derived from Ragtime, clear vocal delivery, and influences from other American Folk Music forms such as Appalachian Folk Music and Traditional Country.

Developing in the early 20th century, Piedmont blues enjoyed a few decades of popularity before declining in the post-World War II era. Although named for the Piedmont region, its defining features were prominent among ragtime blues guitarists across the Deep South.

In the 1950s, Piedmont blues experienced a revival within the folk music scene, gaining a cult following. While it has seen little mainstream success since then, the genre continues to influence Contemporary Folk and various Blues styles, maintaining a dedicated underground following.
