Celtic New Age music is characterized by songs often performed by prominent female vocalists such as Enya and Loreena McKennitt. These songs combine ambient sounds, rhythmic beats, and ethereal vocals, blending elements of Celtic Folk Music with contemporary influences. The compositions frequently evoke pastoral imagery and romantic themes, sometimes drawing on Celtic folklore. In addition to vocal pieces, the genre includes instrumental tracks featuring arrangements of harps, whistles, fiddles, violins, and keyboards. Other notable artists in this genre include Clannad, Llewellyn, Gary Stadler, Secret Garden, and Dagda.

Eithne Pádraigín Ní Bhraonáin, known professionally as Enya, is an Irish singer and composer renowned for her distinctive musical style. With global album sales exceeding 90 million, Enya stands as the best-selling Irish solo artist and is second only to U2 among Irish music acts. Her signature sound is characterized by layered vocals, rich instrumentation, extended reverb, and influences from Celtic music.
