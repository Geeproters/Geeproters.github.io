Mai on YouYube makes some fantastic playlists for a bunch of different genres.

Here are some of my favorites:
https://youtu.be/Uw7yxvjCaC8 (High BPM breakcore, hardcore breaks, D&B, etc)
https://youtu.be/pixBKxFndPg (Bebop, big band, free form, fusion, etc)
https://youtu.be/8CwB4T1nkaM (Bossa Nova, lounge, shibuya-kei, soundtrack, etc)

f7bc46504a2db22aa89b9d96e7b4199ef457e527fdcbb14aea51d5fe0b3294c6 is also really nice for Japanese jazz specifically


You may have noticed all of the titles are encoded differently. I'm struggling with the last one, which was uploaded an hour ago.

Here's how to decode the 2nd one, as an example:

|| At 0:13 the key is the formula || 

|| If you do the math -> it turns out its 68-48 : 00 -> 20:00 ||

|| At timestamp 20:00 you get the phrase "can we make a difference". This is 24 characters long, which is a common length for aes 192.||

|| Trying ecb first -> result is a base64 value. This is convenient https://devglan.com/online-tools/aes-encryption-decryption ||

|| Decode the base 64 value and you get the answer. Use https://www.base64decode.org/ or run a python script ||


The others also seem to usually use ||ECB or CBC||

Their playlist jpjrr/SAsLCZNunpFnccg0hWQ9Rn4PEc4M5yGHLFEol48AJvnibdyk5vG93F/iYdJPlKCyop/4PeRlFBZB7dHw== has the IV and key in the description, so it's easy to decrypt
