The mod revival movement of the late 1970s and early 1980s, much like the original Mod trend from the 1960s, was more focused on fashion than music. However, a distinct musical genre did emerge as part of the revival. While it shared some characteristics with the original mod style, particularly in its strong rhythm and stripped-down beat influenced by Rhythm & Blues, it leaned more towards British Rock (especially British Rhythm & Blues) than American R&B.

Unlike the 1960s mod, the mod revival music also incorporated significant elements of Punk Rock, and shared some similarities with the Pub Rock, 2 Tone, and second-wave Power Pop genres that were popular in the early days of the New Wave movement in the UK. However, the mod revival was less successful in the US. Some later bands within the movement also experimented with elements of the 1980s Garage Rock revival and Neo-Psychedelia, with the American Paisley Underground scene drawing from many of the same influences.

The Jam was the most dominant band in the mod revival scene, overshadowing other groups such as The Prisoners and The Times, which, despite being notable, did not achieve the same level of popularity or critical acclaim. Interest in mod revival resurfaced in the 1990s with the rise of Britpop, particularly with bands like Ocean Colour Scene, and it also influenced American Indie Rock groups like Chisel during that time.
