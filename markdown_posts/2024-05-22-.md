Funk ostentação is a subgenre of Funk brasileiro that began in the late 2000s in the region of São Paulo metro area and the Baixada Santista in São Paulo state.

The genre emerged essentially after 2008, with MCs such as Backdi & BioG3 and MC Boy do Charmes gaining popularity within the São Paulo suburbs after the promotion of local funk festivals. In 2012, funk ostentação artist MC Daleste was shot on stage during a show in Campinas, São Paulo state, an event that garnered much media attention and furthered the exposure of the genre.

Funk ostentação is mainly influenced by Hip Hop, especially Pop Rap, and typically has a more pop-oriented sonority than other styles of funk brasileiro. Lyrically, funk ostentação often centers around women, money, consumer goods, and references to clothing, beverages, and motorcycle and car brands. Aesthetically, it is heavily influenced by Gangsta Rap.

Music videos are important, even essential, to the popularity of a funk ostentação track. KondZilla, one of the most relevant artists in the scene, acts as a director and producer for funk ostentação music videos. His YouTube channel, Canal KondZilla, is the most subscribed-to channel in Brazil, and is used as a platform to promote other major funk ostentação artists like MC Guimê, MC Rodolfinho, and MC Gui.
