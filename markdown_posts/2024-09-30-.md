The Bhundu Boys were a Zimbabwean band that played a mixture of chimurenga music with American rock and roll, disco, country, and pop influences. Their style became known as jit, and is quite popular across Africa, with some international success, and has influenced later groups like Nehoreka and Mokoomba.

Jit is guitar-driven electric pop music from Zimbabwe that draws influence from Central and East African rumba, South African jive and local music. 

Here's The Shed Sessions, a compilation of their music from 1982-1986
