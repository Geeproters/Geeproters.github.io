Benjamin Fernando Barajas Lasky, better known by his stage name Quadeca, is an American rapper, singer-songwriter, record producer, YouTuber and former video game commentator.

Here's his 2025 Art/Prog Pop single Godstained

Influences from a wide range of sources, including chamber folk, bossa nova, and hip hop.

The music video is also well shot. This is my introduction to Quadeca, and apparently he went in a new direction for this track. I'm excited to hear what else he does in this realm in the future.
