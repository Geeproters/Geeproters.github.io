Arvo Pärt’s Passio Domini Nostri Jesu Christi secundum Joannem (commonly known as the St. John Passion or simply Passio) is a musical setting of the Passion narrative from the Gospel of John. Composed for solo baritone (representing Jesus), solo tenor (as Pilate), a vocal quartet (Evangelist), choir, and a small ensemble of violin, oboe, cello, bassoon, and organ, the piece has a runtime of about 70 minutes. It follows the Latin text of John 18 and 19, bookended by a brief introduction and conclusion.

Here's the Hilliard Ensemble’s recording here, from 1988:

Pärt began developing Passio while still in Estonia, taking the initial sketches with him when he moved to Austria in 1980. The composition, deeply rooted in his signature tintinnabuli style, was completed in 1982 and published in 1989. Since then, it has been recorded multiple times and remains among his most well-known works. Much like his broader compositional approach, Passio draws inspiration from medieval musical traditions, particularly the earliest monophonic Passion settings. Structurally, the piece is through-composed, with the Evangelist role performed by an SATB vocal quartet and Jesus and Pilate represented by solo voices. The instrumentation is minimal yet precise, featuring four solo instruments alongside the organ and full choir.
