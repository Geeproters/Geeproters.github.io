Promises is a 2021 collaboration album by electronic music producer Floating Points, jazz saxophonist Pharoah Sanders, and The London Symphony Orchestra
https://youtu.be/Mn8x0QbN4f8

A continuous piece of orchestral music in nine movements for saxophone, strings, keyboards and electronics, composed by Sam Shepherd. I consider it to be a masterpiece of orchestral-electronic collaboration, and it may be my favorite Jazz or Jazz-adjacent album ever. Certainly my favorite from the past 3 decades.

This was the last album Pharoah Sanders worked on. An instant Post-Minimalism/Third Stream classic. Meditative, ethereal, lush, and beautiful. Incredibly well-recorded.

As with a lot of orchestral music, I'd recommended listening through from start to finish without pause. This album demands my full attention, and that's what I try to give it. For me, a great way to make 45 minutes feel like 10.
