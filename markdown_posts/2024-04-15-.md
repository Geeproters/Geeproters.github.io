Taquirari is a musical tradition developed by the indigenous peoples of eastern Bolivia. The genre is thought to have originated within the Moxo culture in the northeastern region of the country (the current Beni Department) being also an established tradition in the rural areas of Santa Cruz. Like other genres from that area, it combines indigenous and Hispanic elements. It might have originated as a form of Moxo ritual music to invoke the god of hunting. After the Spanish colonization, the genre expanded beyond its ceremonial setting as popular form of dance music in the region, thus becoming part of the Bolivian creole culture.

Traditional instrumentation includes handheld drums (bombo, caja) and flutes (quena), as well as the charango, a small creolized guitar considered the national instrument of Bolivia. Taquiraris are pentatonic, which suggests cultural exchange with Indigenous Andean Music, especially Huayno.

During the 19th century, the genre spread to the northern regions of Chile, Argentina and Uruguay; many famous taquirari perfomances and compositions have been done by artists from these regions including Alfredo Zitarrosa and Horacio Guarany. Bolivian singer/songwriter Matilde Casazola is an important exponent of the genre in its native country, and Percy Ávila was one of the most prolific composers. The first group to popularize the genre across Bolivia was Las Kantutas, a female duo from La Paz that played live on the radio and recorded several singles during the 1940s. In the late 1960s, Los Jairas kept the style in vogue, and today many traditional ensembles continue to play taquiraris.

It's difficult to find a high-quality recording of traditional Taquirari. Here are some less traditional works that take influence from the genre:
