Dark jazz is a contemporary style that blends traditional jazz instrumentation with a slow, somber tone to create a cinematic, doom-laden atmosphere. Emerging in the 1990s and gaining traction in the 2000s, particularly in Europe, the genre features key acts like Bohren & der Club of Gore and The Kilimanjaro Darkjazz Ensemble. A significant early influence was Angelo Badalamenti’s Twin Peaks soundtracks, starting in 1990, which combined ambient and lounge elements with surreal jazz sounds, shaping the genre’s development.

Heavily inspired by the moody visuals and dark themes of film noir, dark jazz evokes imagery of smoky, dimly-lit clubs and rain-soaked streets. It draws from the crime jazz scores of mid-20th century noir films like Ascenseur pour l'échafaud, The Man With the Golden Arm, and Taxi Driver, but with a much slower tempo and an intensified sense of gloom. The music typically features mournful trumpets, saxophones, brushed drums, electric piano, mellotron, vibraphones, and double bass while omitting the upbeat sections common in big band jazz.

Dark jazz often incorporates eerie textures from dark ambient music and, since the 2010s, electric elements akin to post-rock, as seen in acts like Lowering or Radare. Some artists even blend the genre with post-metal and doom metal influences, adding a further layer of weight and intensity.
