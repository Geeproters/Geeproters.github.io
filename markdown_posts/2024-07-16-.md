Christopher Nicholas "Nick" Bertke (born 26 July 1988), better known by his stage name Pogo, which is symbolized by an icon of a rabbit, is a South African-born Australian electronic musician. Much of his work consists of recording small sounds, quotes, and melodies from films, TV programmes or other sources, and sequencing the sounds together to form a new piece of music (a genre also known as plunderphonics). 

I used to listen to him a bit back in elementary school. In the past decade he's been involved in various controversies due to some very assholish homophobic and misogynistic statements he's made online, so I haven't felt a real desire to listen to his music again.

In any case, if I separate the artist from the art, I am able to enjoy his music. His work was pretty major in getting me into electronic music, so for that reason it's nice to revisit.
