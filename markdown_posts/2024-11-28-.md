Footwork

Footwork, a fast-paced dance and electronic music style, emerged in Chicago's South and West Sides in the late 1990s. Rooted in Ghetto House and Juke, with influences from Hip Hop, it features syncopated rhythms, repetitive samples, skittering drum fills, and sub-bass in place of a 4/4 kick. Typically around 160 BPM, footwork is known for "battle tracks" crafted for competitive dancers, often featuring war-like trumpet sounds. Many producers, like DJ Manny, started as dancers themselves.

RP Boo is credited as the genre's pioneer, shifting away from Juke's 4x4 groove. Early tracks like "Baby Come On" and DJ Clent's "3rd World" helped define its sound. In the late 2000s, compilations like Bangs & Works Vol. 1 & 2 and DJ Rashad’s Double Cup brought footwork global recognition. Chicago crews such as Teklife and labels like Lit City Trax popularized the style further.

By the 2010s, footwork gained traction in Japan and Europe, evolving through artists like Machinedrum, who blended UK Bass influences, and Jlin, who pushed the genre’s boundaries.

Here are two tracks from DJ Rashad's 2013 album Double Cup
