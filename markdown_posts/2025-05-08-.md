Metalcore is a fusion of Hardcore Punk and Metal that emerged in the early 1990s, known for its heavy, drop-tuned guitars, double kick drumming, and harsh vocals. A defining feature is the breakdown, a rhythm-heavy section emphasizing slow, percussive playing. Early bands like Integrity and Earth Crisis were influenced by Crossover Thrash and New York Hardcore, with later shifts toward Thrash and Groove Metal, especially drawing from Slayer's style.

In the late 1990s, Melodic Metalcore (e.g., Shadows Fall) incorporated Melodic Death Metal influences, while Mathcore (e.g., Converge) introduced technical complexity. Deathcore emerged by blending metalcore with Death Metal.

The 2000s saw metalcore's mainstream rise, with bands like Killswitch Engage, Bullet for My Valentine, and Bring Me the Horizon gaining major followings. Crossovers with Post-Hardcore, Emo, and Progressive Metal became common, and subgenres like Electronicore, Easycore, and Nu Metalcore appeared.

Since the 2010s, metalcore's popularity declined in the mainstream as some bands moved to lighter styles. However, a revival of heavier metallic hardcore acts like Knocked Loose and Code Orange gained critical acclaim.
