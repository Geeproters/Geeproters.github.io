Tearout is a form of Dubstep that developed in the late 2000s. It is characterized by a gritty, aggressive, and dancefloor-focused sound, emphasizing punchy and dominant midrange, "wobbly" sound design, contrasting with the atmospheric and deep sound of earlier dubstep. Tearout generally features greater dynamic differences throughout the track as well, often with pronounced drops and buildups, that somewhat contrast with earlier, repetitive styles. That being said, some tearout is equally repetitive, and earlier dubstep sometimes featured drop-buildup structures as well. First pioneered by artists in the mid-2000s UK dubstep scene, such as Rusko and Caspa, tearout would quickly rise to become one of the most influential and controversial styles in the dubstep scene. As the 2000s came to a close, tearout producers began developing a new sound that maintained the aggression of tearout but featured increased variation in the drops, and lacked the rolling, deep basslines of tearout. The new sound further emphasized low, growling synths and/or high-pitched leads, and it would come to be known as Brostep.

Here's a track from Culprate's 2011 album Flatline. I mentioned Culprate before all the way back on day 308.
