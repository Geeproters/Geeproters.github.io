Jazz-funk blends the rhythmic drive and repetitive bass lines of funk with jazz, replacing traditional swing rhythms with a steady groove. This genre often features horn sections playing riffs, lengthy tracks built around a one- or two-chord vamp, and solo instruments like keyboards, saxophones, or electric guitars. Emerging in the late 1960s, jazz-funk drew inspiration directly from funk, unlike its predecessor, soul jazz, which had more influence from Rhythm & Blues and Gospel. The genre embraced electric instrumentation, including guitars, bass, keyboards, and synthesizers, paving the way for later synth funk. Early examples of jazz-funk, like Herbie Hancock's Fat Albert Rotunda and Miles Davis' Bitches Brew, blended funk rhythms with avant-garde jazz. The genre gained mainstream success with Hancock's Head Hunters (1973) and was further popularized by groups like Weather Report. Jazz-funk's influence continued into the 1980s, shaping the development of Acid Jazz and impacting dance and hip hop.

Gil Scott-Heron was an American artist recognized for his work as a jazz poet, singer, musician, and author, particularly during the 1970s and 1980s. He became known for his spoken-word performances, which often addressed social and political issues. In collaboration with musician Brian Jackson, Scott-Heron blended jazz, blues, and soul with lyrics that spoke to the struggles of the time. He coined the term "bluesologist" to describe himself, referring to it as "a scientist who is concerned with the origin of the blues." His iconic poem "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised," which he performed over a jazz-soul beat, is regarded as a significant influence on the development of hip hop music.
