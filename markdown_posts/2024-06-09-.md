I think this is the third time I've recced something related to Ghost in the Shell, though from different composers and very different styles each time. I should really watch the show. 

Here's a short but nice track, Barrack, by Nobuko Toda and Kazuma Jinnouchi. This was released in GHOST IN THE SHELL: SAC_2045 Original Soundtrack in 2020
