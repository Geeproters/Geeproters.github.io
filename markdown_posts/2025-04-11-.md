Not a song (but there is some ambient atmospheric audio), but I wanted to briefly talk about this 2021  performance of the opening lines of Under Milk Wood, a 1954 radio drama by Welsh poet Dylan Thomas.

Sheen delivers Thomas's linguistically brilliant and poetic lines with fervent intensity. I find that his performance conjures the imagery evoked by the words perfectly, but I was surprised by his impassioned and urgent take on the delivery. When I read the drama, I felt no urgency, reading instead a dreamlike, soft, lilting cadence. 

Other performances might try to evoke the atmosphere differently, but I'm only impressed by a new angle and a uniqueness to the text.

In any case, its a very emotionally satisfying case for Thomas's verse drama.
