Gothic country is a subgenre of alt-country inspired by the Southern Gothic literary tradition. It blends dark, atmospheric themes with the sounds of American folk and country music to explore topics like poverty, crime, violence, death, and religion. The genre builds on the alt-country foundation by incorporating instruments such as banjo, mandolin, cello, and accordion, drawing influence from traditional country, old-time, bluegrass, and Louisiana music. It also borrows from post-punk, using melancholic tones and haunting vocal styles, sometimes overlapping with folk punk, neofolk, and freak folk. Themes of faith and mortality further connect it to country gospel, outlaw country, and country blues.

The genre emerged in the 1990s in Denver, Colorado, pioneered by 16 Horsepower and Slim Cessna's Auto Club, both featuring former members of the dark cabaret group The Denver Gentlemen. By the 2000s, the Denver scene—dubbed the "Denver Sound"—produced key gothic country acts like DeVotchKa, Munly J. Munly, Wovenhand, and Tarantella. The style also gained national recognition through artists such as The Handsome Family, Murder by Death, Those Poor Bastards, and Sons of Perdition.
