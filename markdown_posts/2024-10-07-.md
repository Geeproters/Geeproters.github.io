To talk a bit more on the 2nd track here from 1387, Libera me:
*Deliver me, O Lord, from death eternal on that fearful day,
When the heavens and the earth shall be moved,
When thou shalt come to judge the world by fire.

I am made to tremble, and I fear, till the judgment be upon us, and the coming wrath,
When the heavens and the earth shall be moved.

That day, day of wrath, calamity and misery, day of great and exceeding bitterness,
When thou shalt come to judge the world by fire.

Rest eternal grant unto them, O Lord: and let light perpetual shine upon them.*


"Libera me" ("Deliver me") is a responsory sung in the Office of the Dead ([a prayer cycle of the Canonical Hours in the Catholic, Anglican and Lutheran Churches, said for the repose of the soul of a decedent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_the_Dead)) in the Catholic Church, and at the absolution of the dead, a service of prayers for the dead said beside the coffin immediately after the Requiem Mass and before burial. The text asks God to have mercy upon the deceased person at the Last Judgment.

In addition to the Gregorian chant in the Roman Gradual, many composers have written settings for the text, including Tomás Luis de Victoria, Anton Bruckner, Giuseppe Verdi, Gabriel Fauré, Maurice Duruflé, Igor Stravinsky, Benjamin Britten, Sigismund von Neukomm, Orlande de Lassus, Krzysztof Penderecki, Antonio Salieri, Lorenzo Perosi, Arnold Rosner and Patrick Gowers. 

Here's a performance of Gabriel Fauré's setting for Libera Me (~1887)

Here's a performance of Giuseppe Verdi's from 1874, one of the most dramatic and powerful interpretations

Here's a performance of Maurice Duruflé's from 1947, another popular version, but my least favorite among these three

Libera me is among my favorite responsories. The other versions are worth a listen as well.
