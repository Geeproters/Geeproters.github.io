Yeule is the musical project of Nat Ä†miel, a Singaporean songwriter and producer. Formed in 2012, they incorporate elements of ambient, glitch and Asian post-pop. Their name is derived from a Final Fantasy character, the Paddra Nsu-Yeul.

I really enjoyed their 2023 album Softscars

Indietronica thoroughly infused with an ethereal dream pop feel.
