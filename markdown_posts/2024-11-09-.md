The "Think" break is a famous drum break from the 1972 song "Think (About It)" by soul singer Lyn Collins, written and produced by James Brown, and performed by drummer John "Jabo" Starks. Widely sampled across popular music, this break gained traction after it appeared in 1987 on the 16th volume of Ultimate Breaks & Beats, a well-known compilation for hip hop producers. 

That year marked the first known use of the "Woo! Yeah!" break, sampled in Cookie Crew's track "Females (Get On Up)":

The break's popularity surged in 1988 when it was prominently featured as the backing loop for "It Takes Two" by Rob Base & DJ E-Z Rock, a platinum-selling hit composed mostly of samples from "Think (About It)":

The "Think" break soon became nearly ubiquitous in late 1980s and early 1990s dance and hip-hop music and remains widely used today. Besides the "Woo! Yeah!" portion, other elements of the break have been popular in various breakbeat genres like jungle, drum and bass, and breakcore, often with the shout sped up for a distinctive sound.


Here's a track from La Toya Jackson's 1989 album Bad Girl, which makes great use of the sample at around 1:31.
