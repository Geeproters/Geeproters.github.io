Leslie Feist, known mononymously as Feist, is a Canadian and American indie pop singer-songwriter and guitarist, performing both as a solo artist and as a member of the indie rock group Broken Social Scene. Feist launched her solo music career in 1999 with the release of Monarch.

She has received 11 Juno Awards (Canada's most prestigious music award), including two Artist of the Year awards.

Here's 1,2,3,4, a 2007 single from Feist

This song became a surprise hit after being featured in a commercial for the iPod nano, hitting No. 8 in the US, a rare feat for indie rock musicians and even more notable since it hit the Top Ten on the strength of downloads alone. Feist won a Juno Award for the single as "Single of the Year". 

Feist performed an alternate version of "1234" on Sesame Street during its 39th season (2008), teaching children to count to the number four. She said working with the Muppets was a career highlight.
