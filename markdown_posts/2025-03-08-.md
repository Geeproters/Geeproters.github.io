Converging Ages is a 2008 Progressive Metal/Melodic Death Metal album by Inanna

My favorite Metal album at the moment. I don't love the vocals, but I usually don't love metal vocals.

The album is focused on melodic, progressive, and technical elements, but it has strong old school death metal bones that it doesn't try to shake. It starkly contrasts much lighter sections with its heavier, evil sounding riffs (eg. at 28:10) which makes for an entertaining listening experience and a psychedelic, surreal atmosphere.
