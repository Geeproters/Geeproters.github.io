Delta Blues

Delta Blues is named after the Mississippi Delta region of the USA where the genre developed. It is regarded as one of the earliest styles of Blues music and displays many of the hallmarks of traditional blues – the call-response lyrical format and the 12-bar structure for example.

The primary instruments of delta blues are the acoustic guitar and the harmonica with many artists also employing slide guitar techniques (often on the steel guitar); the ‘Dobro’ or national resonator guitar was also popular. The structure is highly rhythmic and the vocals are clear and strong with repeated lines a trademark. The subject matter is often personal and covers the hard life experienced by the southern African-American farming communities that populated the delta in the late 19th century and first half of the 20th century.

Charley Patton, Son House and Robert Johnson are perhaps the best known of the original delta bluesmen with Ishman Bracey, Mississippi John Hurt, Tommy Johnson and Skip James also highly regarded. Later on the likes of Muddy Waters and John Lee Hooker started making delta blues before becoming better known for their work in Chicago & Detroit.
