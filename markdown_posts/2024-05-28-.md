Weightless is a style of instrumental Grime that developed in the early 2010s, characterized by "weightless", sparse percussion, and atmospheric, spectral production. Tracks are usually more soundscape-oriented and less rhythm-focused than traditional grime instrumentals, occasionally bordering on Ambient music, and often incorporating UK Bass' airy, nocturnal, and sub-bass heavy sound. In 2014, key figures Mumdance and Logos established the label Different Circles for releases in their distinct style, and released Weightless Volume One, which helped coin the genre's name.

Even though, in contrast with traditional grime, weightless is a producer-centric genre, there have been several notable vocal weightless tracks, such as Novelist and Mumdance's "1 Sec" though in terms of vocal delivery the genre is usually not distinct from grime as a broader category, only occasionally being more experimental in delivery. Despite somewhat declining in popularity throughout the 2010s, weightless would sometimes remain an influence into later and concurrent styles like Deconstructed Club, Alternative R&B, and even Wave.
