Tone poem is a programmatic Orchestral Music work, usually in a single movement, that is entirely based on external non-musical themes, ideas, tales, etc. Tone poems arose at the second half of the 19th century and remained popular throughout the 20th century. The term was coined by Franz Liszt when he described his 13 orchestral works as "symphonic poems". Among other famous composers of tone poems are Claude Debussy, Hector Berlioz, Richard Strauss or Bed≈ôich Smetana. Gustav Holst's "The Planets" is one example.

The name "Scheherazade" refers to the main character Scheherazade of One Thousand and One Nights. It is one of Rimsky-Korsakov's most popular works.

This album is one of the few that has been available in vinyl almost continuously since it came out.
