Coined by In/Humanity, emoviolence came out of the burgeoning Screamo and Powerviolence scenes, building upon the volatile approach taken by early bands such as Honeywell and Makara. The primary innovators in the emoviolence scene are generally regarded as Orchid, pageninetynine, and Jeromes Dream, who all took an extremely aggressive approach even by the standards of screamo. Songs were shortened to the point that they rarely surpassed three minutes, unconventional methods of screaming were utilized, and blast-beats were often used. These changes marked a profound influence from the Californian powerviolence and Grindcore scenes. Artists like Reversal of Man and Combatwoundedveteran, both from the vibrant Florida screamo scene, bridged the gap between the two genres, foregoing a fusion and instead swapping approaches on releases and tracks.
