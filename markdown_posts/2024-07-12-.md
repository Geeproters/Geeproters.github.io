Erica Abi Wright, known professionally as Erykah Badu, is an American singer and songwriter. Influenced by R&B, soul, and hip hop, Badu rose to prominence in the late 1990s when her debut album Baduizm, placed her at the forefront of the neo soul movement, earning her the nickname "Queen of Neo Soul" by music critics.

I've mentioned her on recs 539, 693, and 888.

Mama's Gun is a 2000 Neo-Soul album by Erykah Badu. Here's a mix of some of the tracks off the full album, which is around 70 minutes total.

Really lush, warm, and mellow.
