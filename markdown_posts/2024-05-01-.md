Young Scrolls is a musical artist and project that aims to parody or adapt the Elder Scrolls video game series by mixing it with modern real-life tropes, like pop music or internet memes.

Started in 2016, the project was originally known for creating songs with lyrics produced by “sentence mixing” the games' original voice lines, but would become later on a cross-medium effort. The project started with EDM and synthwave, moving on to hip hop.

Unironically really great music. His knowledge of the elder scrolls lore is incorporated so well its crazy

Here are some of his longer releases and their concepts:

JIUB - SAINT features Jiub, a character from Morrowind and later a saint of the Tribunal Temple and the New Temple. He was canonized for driving the cliff racers from the island of Vvardenfell in Morrowind.

GLARTHIR - NUTTY features Glarthir, a minor character from Oblivion who believes that he is constantly being watched and conspired against. He believes that Bernadette Peneles, Toutius Sextius, and Davide Surilie are in on the plot against him.

SHEOGORATH - ZOOM features Sheogorath, a recurring character from the games. The Daedric Prince of Madness. His realm in Oblivion is known as the Shivering Isles, separated into two distinct communities: Mania, the fantastic, colorful side, where art enthusiasts and insane revelers reside, and Dementia, the horrific, dark and ominous side, inhabited by those with the darker side of Sheogorath's blessings.

Just a couple of days ago he released LORKHAN, a complete reimagining of Skyrim's soundtrack.

LORKHAN is a deliberate departure from Jeremy Soule's style, with decidedly less ambient instrumentation, providing a different gameplay feel. Pieces have been composed to enhance and recontextualise special or one-off scenes in the game.

LORKHAN attempts to bring greater variety and distinct character to different regions of the game with respect to their cultures and inspirations while avoiding obvious anachronisms:

-Mainland Skyrim features the sounds of the tagelharpa, a Scandinavian staple, as well as the viola da gamba, hoarse violins, fiddles and cellos, and rumbling male choirs. Whiterun wakes up to the sound of kulning, while throat singing can be heard in the corners of the Reach. Music for the major cities is minimalistic, almost melding with the ambience. The music mirrors Skyrim's modern history, and Imperial influence is still audible within.
-The Forgotten Vale is flooded with solemn elven voices and distant bells - remnants of an extinct culture.
-The halls of Castle Volkihar echo with haunting organs and cellos.
-Solstheim is a far cry from civilisation, where nature reigns supreme. Its soundtrack is less melodic, focusing on drones, drums and chants. Southern Solstheim features a new soundtrack carefully crafted in an attempt to more accurately portray the despair and hope of the Dunmer people, loosely inspired by the music of the Middle East, Mesopotamia and East Asia and featuring the duduk, erhu and setar.
-The Soul Cairn is chaos of wailing horns, and Apocrypha (which had no unique music prior) takes on an otherworldly and synthy sound.
-Additional optional music for Creation Club dungeons drowns The Cause and Saints & Seducers in drones and reverberating harps, while Umbra receives unique music for its boss fight.

I havent finished listening through this yet, but what I've heard has been extremely impressive
