Here's Luminescent Creatures, a 2025 Singer-Songwriter / Chamber Folk album by Ichiko Aoba, at this point, maybe my favorite singer songwriter.

The album is currently ranked #1 for 2025 on RYM. 

I talked about Ichiko Aoba's 2020 album Windswept Adan back on rec 599. 

Though she had long been revered in Japan, her international breakthrough came in 2018 with the Western release of qp, followed by the lush, cinematic Windswept Adan. Her latest album, Luminescent Creatures, expands on this grandeur, trading the dense, foggy forests of Adan for a more open and airy soundscape inspired by the Ryukyu Archipelago. With delicate, intricate sonic details, Aoba crafts music that feels as much like a physical space as it does a listening experience.

Breathtakingly beautiful album. Atmospheric, ethereal, and soft, with rich and warm instrumentation. An album I won't switch off of partway through.
