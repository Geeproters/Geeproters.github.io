Conjunto Andino 

Conjuntos Andinos are urban folk ensembles featuring Andean Indigenous instruments like the zampoña, kena, charango, and bombo, typically comprised of four to six musicians. Their repertoire encompasses diverse genres such as Huayno, Cueca, and more, often performed at folk shows. Originating from Criollo and Mestizo artists, this tradition gained international prominence in the 1950s and 1960s through Argentine bands like Los Incas and Los Calchakis, who introduced stylized Andean music to European audiences. Chilean groups like Inti-Illimani and Quilapayún continued this trend in the 1970s.

In Bolivia, the Conjunto Andino format became popular in the late 1960s, with influential ensembles like Los Jairas playing a pivotal role. Despite its association with leftist politics in Chile and elsewhere in Latin America, Bolivians viewed Conjunto Andino as a national expression rooted in criollo-mestizo folk music, distinct from the Pan-Latin Americanist ideologies. This nuanced understanding reflects differing cultural perceptions of Conjunto Andino across the Andean region.
