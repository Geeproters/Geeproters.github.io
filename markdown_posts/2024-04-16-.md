Carnaval cruceño (or simply “carnaval") is a danceable genre, similar to the Polka, from the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra in Bolivia’s tropical east. As its name suggests, it is the characteristic music of the area’s Carnival celebrations. Carnavales are generally composed for brass band musicians.

Carnaval was the first form of música oriental to gain popularity outside of the eastern lowlands. Rhythmically, carnavales feature the sesquiáltera hemiola (interplay between 6/8 and 3/4 meters), a Spanish colonial legacy also found in Cuecas and bailecitos. Whereas Bolivian cuecas and bailecitos follow AABA sectional form, though, AABB or AABBCC represent the standard setups for carnavales (as well as for Bolivian Huayños and many other Bolivian genres). Melodically, most carnaval tunes adhere to the major mode. 

Not a great recroding, but here's a track from Carnaval cruceño 82 by Banda Cara'e Palo Jrs. Released 1982  https://youtu.be/rMjQafkyNIU?list=OLAK5uy_nJq6nOfyy4c_oqeNl48sL8V_SEvEFTEok
