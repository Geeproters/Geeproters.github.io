Riddim is a sub-genre of Dubstep that features heavy use of repetition, wet, metallic sound design, and wobbly basses, pulling from older dubstep. The sound was first anticipated in wobble-heavy dubstep and Tearout in the late 2000s with artists such as Jakes, Kromestar and Lost, as well as other releases on Jakes' label Hench Recordings. Their influence would start to emerge into the early 2010s, with then-small dubstep producers and groups on the internet, who would distribute their music through SoundCloud and Facebook. Other acts take the sound into a wonkier and more synth-heavy direction.
