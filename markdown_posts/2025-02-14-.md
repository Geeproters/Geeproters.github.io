Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu (1971–2017), widely known as Gurrumul and posthumously referred to as Dr. G. Yunupingu, was a Yolŋu Aboriginal Australian musician. A talented multi-instrumentalist, he played the drums, keyboards, guitar, and didgeridoo. However, it was his distinct and soulful singing voice that earned him widespread recognition. His songs told the stories of his homeland, performed in Yolŋu languages such as Gaalpu, Gumatj, and Djambarrpuynu as well as in English. He started his musical journey as part of Yothu Yindi before joining the Saltwater Band, eventually gaining broader acclaim as a solo artist. 

At the time of his passing, he was the most commercially successful Aboriginal Australian musician, with global record sales estimated at half a million as of 2020.

Here are two tracks from the 2018 album Djarimirri: Child of the Rainbow, which he was able to finish before he died.

Beautiful and engaging post-Minimalism mixed with elements of Indigenous Australian Traditional Music.
