Piety of Ashes is a 2017 album by Benn Jordan AKA The Flashbulb

I've been listening to him every so often since I mentioned him on 390. This album isn't one of his best-regarded, but I like it. Contrary to his other, more breakcore-leaning works, this one lies in the realm of ambient and downtempo.

It's a relaxed listen, but it makes great use of texture, which keeps it engaging and interesting.

I'm not a big fan of the vocoded singing on Starlight and Gray Pill, but it's not hard to get past.
