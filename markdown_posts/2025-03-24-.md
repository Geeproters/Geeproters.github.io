The duduk is a traditional Armenian double-reed woodwind instrument, made from apricot wood. It has been in use for over 1500 years and is recognized for its distinct, low-pitched tones. The instrument consists of a cylindrical body with finger holes and a large reed, which produces its characteristic tone. It has similarities with instruments such as the Balaban, Mey, Zurna, and Sorna from West and Central Asia, but the duduk's soft, breathy tone is distinct due to its wide reed and cylindrical bore.

Unlike many other woodwinds, the duduk is often played using circular breathing, allowing for continuous sound, and lending a meditative quality to duduk music.

Historically, the duduk has been an important part of Armenian folk music, used in various cultural and social events, including weddings and funerals. The instrument’s sound has also been incorporated into film scores and world music, gaining international recognition. Notable musicians such as Djivan Gasparyan have contributed to its global presence. Today, the duduk continues to be played both in traditional settings and in contemporary compositions.

Djivan Gasparyan (1928–2021) was an Armenian musician and composer known for his mastery of the duduk. He began playing at a young age and became one of the most prominent figures in preserving and popularizing the instrument worldwide. Gasparyan performed both traditional Armenian music and collaborated with international artists across various genres, including Peter Gabriel, Hans Zimmer, and Brian Eno. His album I Will Not Be Sad in This World introduced many listeners to the duduk’s distinctive sound, and his contributions helped integrate the instrument into global film scores and contemporary music.
