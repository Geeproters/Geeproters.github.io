Les Filles de Illighadad is a groundbreaking Tuareg band founded by Fatou Seidi Ghali in the village of Illighadad, Niger. Ghali is widely recognized as the first Tuareg woman to play the guitar professionally, defying cultural norms where women traditionally performed tende—a percussive music using a drum made from mortar and pestles—but not guitar. Teaching herself on her brother's guitar, Ghali blended tende rhythms with guitar melodies, creating a unique sound that honors and reimagines Tuareg musical traditions. Alongside her cousin Alamnou Akrouni and other members, Ghali formed the band to showcase this fusion and highlight women's role in Tuareg music innovation.

Les Filles de Illighadad have released several albums through the Sahel Sounds label, with recordings captured outdoors in their village and during performances abroad. Their growing acclaim led to European and U.S. tours, including a notable live album recorded at Pioneer Works in Brooklyn in 2019. Critics describe their music as meditative, spiritual, and emotionally rich, drawing comparisons to American blues traditions rooted in West African rhythms. Their work has been praised for preserving the essence of village life while evolving Tuareg music into a powerful new form.
