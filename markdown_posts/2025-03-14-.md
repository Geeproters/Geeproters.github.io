Euphoric Hardstyle emerged in the late 2000s and gained popularity in the early 2010s as a more melodic, lighthearted, and accessible form of Hardstyle. Unlike the raw and harsh elements of traditional Hardstyle, Euphoric Hardstyle emphasizes emotional, cinematic synth leads influenced by Uplifting Trance, Hands Up, and Euro-Trance. The genre is also characterized by weaker kicks, minimal or absent reverse basslines, and a greater focus on melodic drops rather than aggressive rhythms, making it closer in sound to mainstream Electronic Dance Music.

The genre was primarily popularized by Dutch producers such as Headhunterz, Wasted Penguinz, and Atmozfears, alongside Belgium’s Da Tweekaz and Coone. Euphoric Hardstyle frequently incorporates emotional, epic vocals, further differentiating it from the rebellious nature of earlier Hardstyle. While it became the dominant form of Hardstyle during the 2010s, some fans criticized it for being overly "cheesy." Its success coincided with the rise of other melodic EDM styles like Festival Progressive House, Future Bass, and Melodic Dubstep, with frequent genre crossovers into Dancefloor Drum and Bass, Trap, and UK Hardcore. Towards the late 2010s, a substyle known as Rawphoric blended Euphoric Hardstyle’s melodies with Rawstyle’s distorted kicks, adding further diversity to the genre.
