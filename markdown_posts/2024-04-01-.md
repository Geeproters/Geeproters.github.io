I grew up watching Naruto, so I guess I've been listening to Ajikan since I was a kid. 

I watched Night Is Short, Walk On Girl a couple of years after it came out, some time in high school.

Despite these two songs having been released more than a decade apart, they both give me a distinct sense of nostalgia for those two periods in my life.

The Night Is Short, Walk on Girl isn't for everybody, but its one of my favorite movies.

Also, vaguely related, here's a track used in The Tatami Galaxy, a series from 2010 by the same director as The Night Is Short, Walk On Girl

That woodwind (alto sax?) has a nice clear tone. Almost sounds like a string instrument
