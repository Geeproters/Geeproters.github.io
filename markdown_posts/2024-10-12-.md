Girolamo Alessandro Frescobaldi (1583 â€“ 1643) was an Italian composer and virtuoso keyboard player. Born in the Duchy of Ferrara, he was one of the most important composers of keyboard music in the late Renaissance and early Baroque periods. A child prodigy, Frescobaldi studied under Luzzasco Luzzaschi in Ferrara, but was influenced by many composers, including Ascanio Mayone, Giovanni Maria Trabaci, and Claudio Merulo. Girolamo Frescobaldi was appointed organist of St. Peter's Basilica, a focal point of power for the Cappella Giulia (a musical organisation), from 21 July 1608 until 1628 and again from 1634 until his death.

Here's Volume 1 of a compilation of his keyboard works, performed on harpsichord and organ.

I timestamped it a bit into Messa della apostoli (Mass of the apostles).

Here's another work, Canzona undecima a due canti "detta la Plettenberger"

This piece is part of a larger collection of fifty-one pieces titled Il Primo Libro delle Canzoni, published in two different editions in Rome in 1628.
