Rasteirinha is a form of music derived from Funk brasileiro, which originated in the Rio de Janeiro area during the early 2010s. It is represented by a slow pace, resting between a tempo of 90-110 BPM, blending a highly rhythmic basis with instrumentation derived from Samba and Axé music, the prominence of inspired grooves from caribbean styles such as Dancehall and Reggaetón (also having comparisons with Ragga) and the easy-going poppy driven attitude from Afrobeats.

Percussive sections are usually repetitive and manipulated as bar-long loops, involving newer beatboxing techniques and slowing down the Tamborzão derived beat of Afro-Brazilian instruments, mainly the atabaque. The term was modeled after the minimalist and slower “funk rasteiro”, an Electro-inflected style of Funk carioca born in the mid-1990s that later was named as “flashback” in retrospect.

Rasteirinha had its popularity peak during the mid-2010s thanks to influential hits "As novinha tão sensacional" by MC Romântico and "Olha a explosão" by São Paulo native MC Kevinho, but began to decline shortly after in the midst of the increasing popularity of Brega funk and Arrocha funk, other slower variations of Brazilian funk that peaked at the same period.
