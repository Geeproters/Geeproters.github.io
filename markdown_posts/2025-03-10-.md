Rhumba was a popular ballroom dance music style that emerged in the 1930s during the "rhumba craze" in the U.S. It was a commercial adaptation of Latin American genres like Son cubano, Bolero, and Rumba cubana, set in a jazz and pop orchestral context. It became more successful than other imported genres like tango and calypso, with Don Azpiazú’s "The Peanut Vendor" (1930) selling over a million copies. Spanish bandleader Xavier Cugat and his Cuban wife Rita Montaner were key figures in popularizing the genre, particularly on the East Coast.

Rhumba's 2/4 meter set it apart from foxtrot and waltz, integrating well with Samba. Its instrumentation featured a brass section, bass, bongos, and congas, with other Latin percussion instruments like maracas and güiro also common. The genre spread to Europe, influencing bandleaders like Edmundo Ros. By the 1940s, artists such as Desi Arnaz and Miguelito Valdés gained popularity, but rhumba declined by the late 1940s, replaced by Mambo and Chachachá, which dominated American ballrooms before Salsa emerged.
