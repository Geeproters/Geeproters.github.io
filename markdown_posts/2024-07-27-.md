Artcore is an EDM genre pioneered in the Japanese doujin and Bemani rhythm game music scenes of the early 2000s. The genre combines the sound design, drum patterns, BPM, and genre conventions of various electronic dance music genres and the instrumentation and melodic stylings of Western Classical Music, most commonly Cinematic Classical. While Drum and Bass is the most common style used in artcore, the influences of the genre are quite eclectic, utilizing the sounds of Trance and Hardcore [EDM]. Many modern artcore artists also utilize more recent types of electronic music such as Brostep and Electro House. Artcore songs are typically short and instrumental, focusing heavily upon creating a highly emotional, awe-inspiring atmosphere. Although mostly known for being produced from Japan, artcore is also made by many Korean producers and overall has a cult following in underground scenes around the world.

Here's Phant Solo II by Taishi.

It's an interesting album that takes influence from many different sources.

Artcore is an inherently varied genre. Here's a track off a 2011 album, Parousia, by xi.

In some ways I think this is indicative of a more typical or classic Artcore sound.
