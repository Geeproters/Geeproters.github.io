Swamp blues originated in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in the 1950s. It takes influences from Zydeco and Cajun Music, and has a laid-back, relaxed rhythm inspired by Jimmy Reed & Lightnin' Hopkins. Slim Harpo and Lightnin' Slim were the most well-known musicians of this genre, and the sound is readily apparent in Creedence Clearwater Revival. 

From Slim Harpo's 1961 album Sings Raining in My Heart
