This might be the 3rd time I've recced something that Pharoah Sanders was involved in, but he may be my favorite Saxophinist so it seems fitting.

Here's Side A of Alice Coltrane's 1970 Spiritual Jazz album Journey In Satchidananda

Meditative and spiritual as you can expect from the genre. Sanders was 30 when he played on this album, compared to Promises (rec 1226) which was recorded when he was 80. It's interesting hearing that difference.
