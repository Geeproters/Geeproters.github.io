Joanna Wang (Wáng Ruòlín), is a Taiwanese-American singer-songwriter, daughter of music producer Bing Wang, born in Taipei but raised in Los Angeles, California.

Here are two songs from her 2019 Chamber Pop / Art Pop cover album 愛的呼喚 [Love Is Calling Me]. The album is a collection of eleven romantic songs originally from the 60s to the 80s; each track allowing Joanna to present a distinctive female character. An international affair, the record sees Joanna perform songs originally by artists from Taiwan, Japan and Hong Kong.
