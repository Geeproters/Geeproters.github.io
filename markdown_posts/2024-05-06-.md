Gang Starr was an American hip hop duo, consisting of Houston-born record producer DJ Premier and Boston, Massachusetts rapper Guru. 

While not as well-known as some of the other artists who worked in the genre (eg. Nujabes, A Tribe Called Quest, or Kendrick Lamar more recently), they are nonetheless recognized for being pioneers of jazz rap. 

Here's one of their more formalist albums, Moment of Truth, from 1998. It's consistently great the whole way through.
