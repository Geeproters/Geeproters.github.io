Experimental big band music refers to Big Bands who dispense with the traditional Jazz structures and Swing sounds, instead performing Avant-Garde Jazz and pushing the boundaries of the medium.

Radical innovation within the big band line-up had already been attempted with Stan Kenton's Progressive Big Band approach in the 1940s, introducing Western Classical Music compositional techniques and idioms, but not going as far as to fully embrace the avant-garde sounds and influences found in the later experimental big bands. The latter started to emerge in the 1960s and 1970s, with bandleaders Charles Mingus, Bill Dixon, Sun Ra and Don Ellis experimenting with the big band format. Works by these plus others such as The Jazz Composer's Orchestra, Carla Bley, Charlie Haden and Globe Unity Orchestra incorporated influences of contemporary jazz and/or Modern Classical trends, most notably Free Jazz and Third Stream.

In the 21st century, the genre continues to exist and evolve, with bands like Fire! Orchestra, Angles 9 and ... incorporating disparate elements such as distorted Jazz-Rock, Balkan Folk Music and EAI respectively, creating their own unique take on the experimental big band template.
