Work Song

Work songs are songs and chants that are sung by laborers and prisoners while working in factories and fields. Work songs typically have a steady rhythm in order to accompany repetitive tasks and often feature improvised homemade instruments. 

A few tracks by Huddie William Ledbetter (~1888 - 1949), better known by the stage name Lead Belly.

Lead Belly was an American folk and blues singer notable for his strong vocals, virtuosity on the twelve-string guitar, and the folk standards he introduced.

These songs, while not all directly labeled as work songs, demonstrate the functions of the genre
