The video draws a parallel between the nation’s resilience and the toughness of steel. The ad highlights everyday grit - people working hard in tough environments - while weaving in steel’s presence in daily life.

The soundtrack, crafted by Sneha Khanwalkar, enhances the 2-minute film’s raw, high-octane energy. Using industrial sounds and rhythmic beats, the music mirrors the power and perseverance the campaign aims to depict.
