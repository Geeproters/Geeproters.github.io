Swamp rock is a subgenre of Roots Rock that incorporates influences from musical styles rooted in the Louisiana region. These influences include the low-toned, reverberated guitar sound of Swamp Blues; the bluesy, uptempo feel of Cajun Music-infused Zydeco; the rhythmic sensibilities of New Orleans R&B; and more guitar-oriented compositions derived from Rockabilly, Country Rock, Blues Rock, and British Invasion bands. Although swamp rock is usually concerned with the realities of the American South and its iconography, and many acts originate from the same area, the style is not region-locked, with some of the most prominent artists hailing from other parts of the United States.

While swamp rock’s origins can be traced back to the Dale Hawkins’ 1950s song “Susie-Q”, the Louisiana singer-songwriter Tony Joe White and the California-based Creedence Clearwater Revival have been described as the pioneers, both incorporating R&B, Country, and Blues elements. Subsequent groups like Little Feat and Redbone further popularized the sound across the United States, but after its modest heyday, swamp rock’s prominence waned as other popular music styles emerged in the mid-1970s. Starting in the early 1990s, the genre experienced a revival in interest, exemplified by the work of Beasts of Bourbon, JJ Grey & Mofro, and post-Acid Bath projects of Dax Riggs.
