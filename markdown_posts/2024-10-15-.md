Country Rock

Country rock is a combination of contemporary Rock music with a more traditional American style of Country. The basic foundation of country rock is acoustic rhythm guitars with electric lead guitar work, pedal steel guitar, harmonica, snare-active drumming, Close Harmony vocals, falsetto notes and distinctive country rhythms.

The genre originated in the mid-1960s to the early 1970s spearheaded by Gram Parsons, Buffalo Springfield, The Byrds, and Eagles partly as a reaction to the Nashville Sound, which had been perceived as dated, slick, and out of fashion with the young audience. Country rock is closely tied to and heavily influenced by Folk Rock, Roots Rock, and Blues Rock, genres which many popular country rock musicians had played some combination of, including Bob Dylan, The Band, and Neil Young.

During the early to mid 1980s, artists from the Punk Rock scene such as Meat Puppets, Violent Femmes, and Jason & The Scorchers incorporated elements of country rock into their music to form Cowpunk. Around this same time, the blend of Punk-based music with the pastoral sounds of country would eventually develop into the Alternative Rock / Indie Rock influenced Alt-Country, led by Uncle Tupelo, Magnolia Electric Co. and The Jayhawks. 

John Weldon "J. J." Cale was an American guitarist, singer, and songwriter. Though he avoided the limelight, his influence as a musical artist has been acknowledged by figures such as Neil Young, Mark Knopfler, Waylon Jennings, and Eric Clapton, who described him as one of the most important artists in rock history.
