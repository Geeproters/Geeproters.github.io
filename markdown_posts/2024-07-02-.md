時代在召喚 (The Rite of Spring) is a 2016 album by 假假條 [JaJaTao] 
https://youtu.be/k5GY7fud_uI

Fantastic Chinese Noise Rock / Grunge / Alternative Metal. Heavy and distorted for much of it with some very surreal or psychedelic sections (49:11) matching the inspiration, The Rite of Spring.

They use some really interesting percussion instrumentation from Chinese Folk Music. Great vocals
