The Yellow River Piano Concerto is a work for piano and orchestra arranged by several Chinese composers, including Yin Chengzong and Chu Wanghua. It is based on the earlier Yellow River Cantata by Xian Xinghai.

Commissioned during the Cultural Revolution and originally overseen by Jiang Qing (wife of Chairman Mao Zedong, see rec 581 on Revolutionary opera), the concerto premiered in 1970 and has since gained significant popularity both in China and internationally.

The piece blends a post-romantic musical structure with thematic elements drawn from revolutionary and patriotic narratives. It features prominent and technically demanding piano sections and is intended to evoke the resilience and spirit of the Chinese people, symbolized by the Yellow River and its historical significance.
