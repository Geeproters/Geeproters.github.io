Slack-key fingerstyle guitar music originated in Hawaii and is typically played with one's thumb in an alternating-bass pattern on the lower two or three strings. The melody line is played on the three or four high strings. Most slack-key tunings drop from the standard EADGBE by lowering or "slacking" strings.
