Crime jazz emerged in the mid-1950s as Jazz music began to be increasingly used in Hollywood Soundtracks. A distinct gritty, moody style developed to accompany the trope of the lonely, brooding, down-on-his-luck protagonist in Film noir movies and hard-boiled detective/crime-themed TV shows.

Unlike Bebop or Cool Jazz, it had a darker, anxious tone, fitting urban post-war settings filled with corruption and danger. The music often featured forlorn trumpet solos, smoky saxophones, punchy brass sections, melancholic piano, and tense percussion for action scenes.

Composers like Elmer Bernstein and Henry Mancini refined the style, with jazz legends like Miles Davis and Duke Ellington later incorporating it into film scores. Crime jazz influenced spy music in the 1960s and continued into the neo-noir films of the 1970s, later serving as a nostalgic reference in games and modern dark jazz.

Here's a track from Murder, Inc., a 1960 album by Irving Joseph, a Bronx-born NYC native who served as conductor for numerous Broadway musicals and plays.
