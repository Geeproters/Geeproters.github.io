Death Grips emerged in 2010 as a groundbreaking force in the hip hop world, blending elements of punk, electronic, and industrial sounds to create a unique aggressive and chaotic experimental style. Their raw energy and unorthodox approach quickly garnered a dedicated following. On stage, they were known for their feral intensity - MC Ride’s visceral performances and Zach Hill’s relentless drumming. The absence of a traditional front-facing media presence added to their mystique.

Over their active years, Death Grips released seven studio albums. These brought industrial hip hop, an Experimental Hip Hop genre that uses Post-Industrial beats and sounds, to immense heights of popularity. Their early 2010's albums pushed boundaries in hip hop.

According to a viral post today (2025-02-09), Death Grips' producer Andy Morin allegedly confirmed the group's disbandment, stating, "Yeah it's over." There's been no official public announcement from the band regarding their status. Personally I doubt there will be.

Reading about their apparent disbandment now, years after their last album in 2018, evokes a real sense of nostalgia. It's nice to be reminded of the impact they've had on my enjoyment of music and my taste.

For me, Death Grips was the second band that I really resonated with. Back in high school, I was captivated enough to use "youshouldlistentodeathgrips" as my Instagram handle. Their fourth album, *The Powers That B*, was the first music I ever purchased with my own money.

Fittingly, the first time I talked about them here was on the 15th entry, almost 4 years ago, in which I posted a few Death Grips mashups I liked.

These were my favorite tracks of theirs from over the years:
