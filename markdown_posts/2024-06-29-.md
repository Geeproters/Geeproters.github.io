Future riddim is a form of Riddim that emerged in the late 2010s. Primarily pioneered by producer Oolacile, future riddim presents a conscious stylistic shift away from the harsh and atonal sounds of Oolacile's and other earlier producers' riddim style, trading LFOs and gritty synths for futuristic, melodic, and vibrant synth leads primarily inspired by Future Bass, and to a lesser extent Melodic Dubstep. 

Like Briddim, future riddim typically features half-time triplets, with prominently side-chained production that highlights the sound design, though it contains a far stronger melodic focus. Oolacile's label Halcyon would become a hub for other producers that helped the growth of the style, featuring up-and-coming producers in compilations like Halcyon Sound Vol. 1 and Enchanted Vol. 1. Many producers would continue to produce more typical riddim alongside future riddim, instead of completely shifting their music in that direction. The rise of future riddim towards the late 2010s would parallel (or follow) the rise of Colour Bass, a similarly melodic and futuristic development of late 2010s Brostep primarily pioneered by Chime and other producers affiliated with his Rushdown label, many of which would also dabble in future riddim alongside colour bass.
