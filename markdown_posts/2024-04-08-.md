The Inti Raymi is a traditional religious ceremony of the Inca Empire in honor of the god Inti, the most venerated deity in Inca religion

Intiraymi is also the name of an ensemble formed in 1987 in Otavalo, Ecuador.

Here's their 1992 album Traditional Music from the Andes.

It could be described as Hispanic American Folk Music, and is Influenced by Indigenous Andean Music.

This is a great album. One of my favorite listens of the past few months for sure.

Music for the soul. Every track is so good.
