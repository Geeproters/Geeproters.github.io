Indigenous Taiwanese music describes the Traditional Folk Music of the various Austronesian people groups that make up the indigenous population of the island of Taiwan. The ancestors of these people have lived on the island for millennia, long before the Han, who now make up the majority of the population, arrived from Mainland China starting in the 1700s. There are two major groups of indigenous Taiwanese, the “mountains indigenous peoples” who live in the mountainous regions of Taiwan, and the “plains indigenous peoples”, who live in the lowlands and have been much more influenced by Chinese culture. There are between 25 and 32 distinct indigenous Taiwanese people groups all together, who speak around 16 languages today. A few of the larger groups are the Amis, Atayal, Paiwan, and Taroko.

Traditionally, indigenous Taiwanese music is performed communally, alongside activities such as working, ceremonies or drinking, rather than as a musical performance to be listened to by an audience. The music is often primarily vocal based, usually sung together polyphonically as a group. It can either be unaccompanied, or alongside traditional instruments such as wooden percussion, jaw harps, flutes, and rattles. Each ethnic group has different names for each instrument, and may have instruments unique to them.

David Darling & The Wulu Bunun - Lugu Lugu Kan-Ibi (Diligent Child)
Lyrics 

There is a lazy child named Ibi
He's not a diligent as Adul
Adul does things swiftly
and energetically.
His grandmother asked him to 
fetch the pipe, 
So he quickly ran and got it for her.
He even jumped up and down
and said, " Grandmother, here is the pipe!" 

(This song shows the relationship between 
grandparents and their grantchild...

A really lovely set of recordings

David Darling was an American cellist and composer. In 2010, he won the Grammy Award for Best New Age Album. He performed and recorded with Bobby McFerrin, Paul Winter Consort, Ralph Towner and Spyro Gyra and released many solo albums.

The Bunun, also historically known as the Vonum, are a Taiwanese indigenous people. They speak the Bunun language. Unlike other aboriginal peoples in Taiwan, the Bunun are widely dispersed across the island's central mountain ranges. In the year 2000, the Bunun numbered 41,038. This was approximately 8% of Taiwan's total indigenous population, making them the fourth-largest indigenous group. They have five distinct communities: the Takbunuaz, the Takituduh, the Takibaka, the Takivatan, and the Isbukun.

The Bunun are well-known for their distinctive and complex polyphonic singing style
