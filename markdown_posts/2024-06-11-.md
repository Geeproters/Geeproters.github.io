Kensuke Ushio is a Japanese composer, rock and EBM musician who performs under the moniker Agraph. He is a member of Japanese rock band Lama. Together with Lama, he released two full-length studio records: New! in 2011 and Modanica a year later. Both albums charted on the Oricon Albums Chart. 

Undoubtedly among my favorite soundtrack composers.

He wrote the soundtracks for Chainsaw Man, DEVILMAN crybaby, A Silent Voice, and several others. I like his music enough that I might as well split this rec into multiple.

First, here are two tracks from Ping Pong

He's a master at using and adapting musical themes and motifs.

Here's another track from Ping Pong thats a good example of what his more hi-energy work is like
