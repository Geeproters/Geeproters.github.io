I haven't been a big fan of Charli XCX's music in the past, but I'm liking this new release

Brat, released June 7th, 2024.

It can be described as Electropop and EDM, with notable influences from genres like Bubblegum Bass and Electroclash. People have a lot to say about it but I don't care enough about Charli XCX to read into the lore. As I hear it, it's a nicely textured, carefully produced record with a cohesive blend of introspective and hedonistic musical elements
