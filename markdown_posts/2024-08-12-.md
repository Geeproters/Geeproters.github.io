I recently played through Bramble: The Mountain King, a short game with simmilarities to Limbo and Little Nightmares. It has a great soundtrack, including what's now one of my favorite renditions of Edvard Grieg's 1875 orchestral work "In the Hall of the Mountain King." It's a slow buildup that approaches its climax as you approach the mountain king and progress his boss fight

Very nice orchestration in general. Always a fan of a hurdy gurdy.
