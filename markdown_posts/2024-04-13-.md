Before I continue with this series related to Indigenous Andean music I wanted to talk about what made me start listening, because it's pretty unexpected in retrospect.

Yume Nikki is a 2004 adventure game created by the pseudonymous Japanese developer Kikiyama. The player controls a girl named Madotsuki and explores her dreams. The game was developed using RPG Maker 2003, and is an exploration-based adventure game with no dialogue, combat, or plot.

I used to make some pixel art back in high school, and gobou, a creator on YouTube, was one of the creators whose work I used as a reference. Over the last 9 years, gobou has put out 24 pixel art videos featuring characters from Yume Nikki, and has had a pretty massive effect on the fanbase, with their most popular videos reaching millions of views.

I watched this recent upload of theirs (https://youtu.be/8l1zY5ndOXI) and decided to read more about the game itself since I wasn't really familiar with it.

One of the most prevalent visual themes in the game is that of Indigenous imagery, from cultures including the Paracas, Nazca, Aztec, Rapa Nui, and various African imagery.

There are various theories related to this imagery in-game that are pretty interesting to read about, but I wanted to learn more about Paracas culture itself, so I decided to listen to some traditional music from the Andes, leading me to that great album on rec 1208.
