Nature Recordings are recordings of natural phenomena such as waterfalls, ocean waves, and storms, as well as animal sounds. 

Soundscape ecologists break down natural sounds into geophony and biophony. Geophony refers to natural sounds produced by non-living things such as the movement of air, water, and rocks. Common examples of geophony are wind, lightning, waterfalls, ocean waves, and avalanches. Biophony refers to non-human biological sounds and are comprised mostly of Animal Sounds. Sounds produced by humans, anthropophony, is a third component of soundscapes that is not included among natural sounds. These 3 classifications are not strictly separate, as one type of sound can be altered by the presence of objects characteristic of another type of sound. For example, the sound of wind will be different when it is blowing through tall grass, through tress, across a barren landscape, or through a city. 

Continuum Unbound is a 2014 three-disc work by Michael Pisaro, with each CD presenting a 72-minute piece.

1. Kingsnake Grey – A continuous field recording of sundown in South Carolina’s Congaree National Park, capturing the natural sonic transformation over 72 minutes. This became the conceptual foundation for the entire trilogy. (GW 011)

2. Congaree Nomads – Built from 24 three-minute field recordings taken by Pisaro and Greg Stuart along trails in the park. The piece traces a slow, sonic journey from Cedar Creek to the Congaree River, layered with instrumental harmonies (“fogs”). (GW 012)

3. Anabasis – A composition in 72 parts for five musicians, inspired by four elemental materials: Sand, Wind, Tone, and Wave. Alongside Pisaro and Stuart, performers include Patrick Farmer, Joe Panzner, and Toshiya Tsunoda. (GW 013)

Together, these works explore how the apparent sonic continuum of the world is actually composed of fragile, shifting states — a study in “discrete continuity” and contingency.
