Rawstyle emerged in the early 2010s as a subgenre of Hardstyle, incorporating influences from earlier Hardstyle and Hardcore EDM, particularly Gabber and Industrial Hardcore. This resulted in a darker, harsher, and more simplistic sound, typically with a faster BPM (150-155 BPM) than previous Hardstyle trends. The genre developed partly as a reaction against Euphoric Hardstyle, which emphasized melodic, emotional drops and vocals. Early rawstyle artists sought to revive traditional Hardstyle and Hardcore elements while maintaining the modern EDM production quality and shorter track structures typical of the 2010s.

Characterized by heavily distorted, side-chained kicks, rawstyle focuses on hard-hitting rhythms rather than complex melodies. High-pitched "screeches" accompany the beats, while reverse basslines, aggressive drops, and ominous vocal samples from sci-fi or horror films contribute to its dark aesthetic. Though often criticized for being repetitive and predictable, some producers experiment with unconventional rawstyle variations. The genre’s visual and thematic style often incorporates apocalyptic, horror, or anti-authoritarian imagery to reflect its intense and atonal nature.

Initially championed by labels such as Minus Is More, A2 Records, and Spoontech Records, rawstyle remained popular throughout the 2010s, particularly in the Dutch Hardstyle scene. Key artists include Radical Redemption, Act of Rage, and Warface, among others. The genre has also evolved into even more extreme substyles like "xtra raw" or "uptempo raw," which blend elements of Hardcore and Frenchcore. Conversely, "Rawphoric" emerged as a hybrid of rawstyle and Euphoric Hardstyle, combining harsh kicks with melodic synth leads and vocals.
