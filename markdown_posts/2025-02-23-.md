Dark cabaret is a melancholic, theatrical style of music influenced by traditional cabaret. Its instrumentation is diverse, featuring everything from pianos and synthesizers to violins, cellos, accordions, and both acoustic and electric guitars and bass. The Tiger Lillies, from the UK, were among the first to adopt this style in the mid-1990s, but it gained wider recognition in the early-to-mid 2000s, largely due to The Dresden Dolls.

Here's a 1999 album, Pequeño, by Bunbury, influenced by the style.
