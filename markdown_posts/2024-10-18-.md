Big Music

The big music is a commercial style of Rock that emerged in the early 1980s, primarily in the UK. Borne of Post-Punk roots, the style features anthemic Pop Rock songwriting and a production style that uses pounding drums, soaring vocals, and ringing, reverb-heavy lead guitar work to create an "epic", arena-ready sound. Beyond the standard rock band setup, big music artists have also incorporated strings and brass in order to sound even larger. Common influences include contemporaneous New Wave guitar groups, Bruce Springsteen's grandiose Heartland Rock, and the acoustic instrumentation and traditional influences of Celtic Rock.

The term "big music" was coined by Mike Scott of The Waterboys to describe his band's sound, codified by their 1984 single "The Big Music". The term was then picked up by critics to describe other popular rock bands of the period with a large, anthemic sound. Many of these groups – U2, Simple Minds, Big Country – featured production from Steve Lillywhite, who innovated the gated reverb technique that was essential for imitating the arena environment in the studio. The big music was most prominent and commercially successful between 1983 and 1987, fading with the growing prominence of harder-edged Alternative Rock (which some big music artists, notably U2, moved on to). Despite remaining strongly associated with the 1980s, the sound of the big music has influenced more recent Indie Rock artists like Arcade Fire as they moved towards a grander, more mainstream-oriented style.
