I forgot to mention this song when I was doing my mandopop recs, maybe I neglected to because I had already mentioned Teresa Teng many times.

"往事只能回味" (Wǎngshì Zhǐ Néng Huíwèi), translated as "The Past Can Only Be Remembered", is a classic Mandarin song from Taiwan's music scene of the early 1970s. It was composed by Liu Jia-chang and written by Lin Huang-kun. The song was first performed by Yao Su-rong in 1970, and later covered by Teresa Teng in 1971.
