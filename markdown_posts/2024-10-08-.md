A couple tracks from 核P-model's 2018 album 回=回 (Kai=Kai)

I've probably mentioned it before, but P-Model a Japanese electronic rock band started in 1979 by members of the defunct progressive rock band Mandrake. The band has experienced many lineup revisions over the years but frontman Susumu Hirasawa was always at the helm of operations. P-Model officially disbanded in 2000, although many of its members continue to release solo albums and collaborate with each other on different projects.

Hirasawa has since released work under the name "Kaku P-Model", effectively a solo revival of the band. 


回=回 is full of bittersweet throwbacks to prior work, including his work not within 核P-model.  Almost an amalgamation of his entire 40+ year career, loaded up with electronic guitar.

Hirasawa's work has never let me down and this album was no exception.
