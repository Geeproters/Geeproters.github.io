Electric Texas blues is a genre of Blues that, although named after the geographic location of its origin, is not bound to that region. It has its roots in Acoustic Texas Blues, from which it developed since the invention of the electric guitar. Notable electric Texas blues artists are T-Bone Walker and Freddie King.

Some characteristics that distinguish it from other genres are the notable Jazz influences such as swing rhythms, extensive single-string guitar soloing, and often the addition of a horn section to the group.

Freddie King was an American blues guitarist, singer and songwriter. He is considered one of the "Three Kings of the Blues Guitar" (along with Albert King and B.B. King, none of whom were blood related). Mostly known for his soulful and powerful voice and distinctive guitar playing, King had a major influence on electric blues music and on many later blues guitarists.
