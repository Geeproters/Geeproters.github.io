Just reliving some memories.

Asian Kung-Fu Generation is a Japanese alternative rock band formed in Yokohama in 1996. For its entire career, the band has consisted of vocalist Masafumi Gotoh, guitarist Kensuke Kita, bassist Takahiro Yamada, and drummer Kiyoshi Ijichi.

I grew up watching Naruto, so I guess I've been listening to Ajikan since I was a kid. 

I watched Night Is Short, Walk On Girl a couple of years after it came out, some time in high school.

Despite these two songs having been released more than a decade apart, they both give me a distinct sense of nostalgia for those two periods in my life.

The Night Is Short, Walk on Girl isn't for everybody, but its one of my favorite movies.

Here's the opening and ending of another nostalgic show for me, Tonari no Seki kun. Might have watched this when I was around 13.

I'm not a big fan of the opening song itself, but it's got a clever and meta video I like.

This ending was one of the most memorable parts of the show for me for both its music and visuals.

Here are some of my favorites:

https://youtu.be/pixBKxFndPg (Bebop, big band, free form, fusion, etc)
https://youtu.be/8CwB4T1nkaM (Bossa Nova, lounge, shibuya-kei, soundtrack, etc)

You may have noticed all of the titles are encoded differently. I'm struggling with the last one, which was uploaded an hour ago.

Here's how to decode the 2nd one, as an example:

|| At 0:13 the key is the formula || 

|| If you do the math -> it turns out its 68-48 : 00 -> 20:00 ||

|| At timestamp 20:00 you get the phrase "can we make a difference". This is 24 characters long, which is a common length for aes 192.||

|| Trying ecb first -> result is a base64 value. This is convenient https://devglan.com/online-tools/aes-encryption-decryption ||

|| Decode the base 64 value and you get the answer. Use https://www.base64decode.org/ or run a python script ||


The others also seem to usually use ||ECB or CBC||

Their playlist jpjrr/SAsLCZNunpFnccg0hWQ9Rn4PEc4M5yGHLFEol48AJvnibdyk5vG93F/iYdJPlKCyop/4PeRlFBZB7dHw== has the IV and key in the description, so it's easy to decrypt

As I've stated several time in the past, breakcore is my favorite genre. 

What I've found is that breakcore and its intense (often dissonant) sound and feel provides an outlet for negative expression and emotional release. Many fans and artists of the genre navigate their own experiences with mental health challenges, maybe finding a sense of understanding or solidarity within the music's dynamic and complex nature, the sound of which could be described as a form of organized chaos.

Going down the rabbit hole, you occasionally stumble across channels like this. Sometimes listeners, sometimes creators.
https://www.youtube.com/@endlesscollectivefm/videos

Some of these video titles are genuinely upsetting and I believe this person may be in a truly unhealthy headspace.

They've been uploading mixes (often the same mix with a different title) almost daily for the past few months. Most of these videos have tens of views.

The past 3 months have been fairly normal compared to the stuff before. Lately it's just been a lot of fringe sexual stuff.

The worse ones come from any time before that. Most of the titles don't need explanation, except maybe all the Sewerslvt stuff. Sewerslvt is an artist I've mentioned a few time in the past (392, 683). She's a trans woman and breakcore artist who retired following the death of her girlfriend, Angel.

It's fucked, but also interesting to just see into someone's psyche like this just by reading through the titles of playlists. It's the type of unfiltered hate and disrespect you can easily see somewhere like 4chan, but usually not youtube.

Anyway, I'm not trying to shame or a insult a person that clearly has some mental issues. All I want to do with this rec here is point to this significant side of breakcore, which can be disturbing and upsetting (especially for victims of hate), but which is also interesting, in its own way.

Really nice breakdown of part of the famous second movement of Ravel's string quartet
https://youtu.be/9zgExtt6C_I
I recommend listening to the whole quartet. It's about 30 minutes long.

From Wikipedia:
Maurice Ravel completed his String Quartet in F major in early April 1903 at the age of 28. It was premiered in Paris in March the following year. The work follows a four-movement classical structure: the opening movement, in sonata form, presents two themes that occur again later in the work; a playful scherzo second movement is followed by a lyrical slow movement. The finale reintroduces themes from the earlier movements and ends the work vigorously.

The quartet's structure is modelled on that of Claude Debussy's String Quartet, written in 1893, although Ravel's musical ideas strongly contrast with Debussy's. Debussy admired Ravel's piece rather more than did its dedicatee, Ravel's teacher Gabriel Fauré. 

The quartet has superficial resemblances to Debussy's String Quartet, written ten years earlier. Debussy approved of his younger colleague's work, and sent him an encouraging letter. The structure of Ravel's quartet is modelled on Debussy's, but where Debussy's music is, in Arbie Orenstein's words, "effusive, uninhibited, and open[ing] up fresh paths", Ravel's displays emotional reticence, innovation within traditional forms, and unrivalled technical mastery. Ravel followed a direction he described as "opposite to that of Debussy's symbolism", abandoning "the vagueness and formlessness of the early French impressionists in favour of a return to classic standards."

Indigenous Andean music refers to the diverse musical styles and genres developed by the indigenous peoples of the Andes. This region encompasses the territory once occupied by Tawantinsuyu, or the Inca empire, where many distinct Indigenous communities live today. Quechua (known as Quichua in Ecuador) and Aymara are the most widely spoken languages in this area.

Traditionally, vocal music is more important among Quechua speakers, while instrumental music is more central to Aymara speakers. Men are the instrumentalists, while women are the preferred singers. The women sing using nasal resonance and emphasize the high part of their range, often using falsetto. Music from this region uses scales with three to seven tones, many with equidistant intervals. Melodic lines tend to have a descending contour and duple meter with syncopated rhythms is common. Musical texture is mostly monophonic, although some wind ensembles perform in parallel octaves, fourths, or fifths. In addition, panpipe ensembles perform in interlocking style, creating a dense sound quality. Music from this region employs sectional forms, in which each short section is immediately repeated. Because the music usually accompanies dancing, the entire piece may be repeated several times.

The content and style of song lyrics vary by genre and community, but many reveal a strong sense of place through references to the local environment. The most distinctive instrument from this region is the siku (Andean panpipe), which is played in ensembles of as many as 50 players, accompanied by four or more large double-headed drums. Music is performed during life-cycle ceremonies, Catholic and indigenous festivals, and fertility rituals associated with agriculture and herding.

Indigenous Andean music continues to evolve in the early twenty-first century, particularly through fusion with other popular music styles.

Huayno 

Huayno is Andean dance music blending pre-Hispanic and Western elements, common among Andean indigenous and mestizo communities. Originating in the colonial era, it evolved as a secular couples' dance, sung in Spanish and Quechua. Instruments include flutes, trumpets, panpipes, violins, guitars, saxophones, and more.

Musically, huaynos are strophic, duple-meter songs with syncopated melodies (e.g., aabb), often ending with a faster fuga section. Variants exist: Carnavalito in NW Argentina, livelier; Chilean huayno less fast; Bolivian huayño slower. Peru's versions vary by region, like the huaynito cusqueño from Cusco.

Huayno influences other rhythms like kaluyo, Chuntunqui romántico, Taquirari, among others. In mid-20th century Lima, it gained urban popularity among highland migrants, leading to stylistic changes and dissemination through recordings and radio. While rural areas maintain its popularity, urban huayno evolves, fusing with styles like Cumbia or Rock, due to its simplicity.


Carnavalito is a style of Huayno that is mostly played in northwestern Argentina in the provinces of Jujuy, Salta, and Tucumán. Its fast and lively pace is mainly characterized by the rhythm of the bombo, which accentuates the strong beats. Guitars and charangos are played to the accompaniment of the bombo, and the accordion, the violin and different notched flutes and panpipes are used as melodic instruments. Generally, the lyrics are cheerful and sung in the regional Spanish of northwestern Argentina.

In addition to this musical tradition, carnavalito is a collective dance with line formations: circles, straight lines, serpentine lines, etc. The dancers move around the musicians or in other formations and a person with a banner or pennant adorned with ribbons in hand is in charge of directing the line.

Bolivian Huayño

Huayño, a beloved genre of Andean music in Bolivia, thrives in Cochabamba, Chuquisaca, La Paz, Oruro, and Potosí. Its structure typically comprises three or four stanzas followed by a coda called fuga or zapateo. Embracing both indigenous and mestizo traditions, it manifests in various styles.

Indigenous huayño in Bolivia exudes liveliness with diatonic or pentatonic melodies, often performed by sikuris (panpipe ensembles) in La Paz and Oruro, or with instruments like pinkillu, charango, and kitarra in Potosí. Cochabamba's huayños cholos, in a style known as k'alampeado, feature syncopated strumming alongside vocals, charango, guitar, and bajo (acoustic bass guitar). Huayño brass bands are integral to the cholos' traditions. Folkloric huayños highlight traditional instruments like kena, charango, bombo, and zampoña, with vocals often exhibiting a polyphonic character influenced by Nueva canción latinoamericana.

Historically, huayño faced elitist dismissal until the late 19th century, cherished by lower-class mestizos and cholos. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, artists like Mauro Nuñez and Los Jairas elevated its cultural status. Nuñez introduced classical guitar techniques to charango, making huayño more palatable to urban audiences. Los Jairas' recordings catered to a Western-oriented middle class, popularizing huayños in peñas folkloricas. By the 1980s, Kjarkas' immense success propelled huayño into the realm of Bolivian national music.

Before I continue with this series related to Indigenous Andean music I wanted to talk about what made me start listening, because it's pretty unexpected in retrospect.

Yume Nikki is a 2004 adventure game created by the pseudonymous Japanese developer Kikiyama. The player controls a girl named Madotsuki and explores her dreams. The game was developed using RPG Maker 2003, and is an exploration-based adventure game with no dialogue, combat, or plot.

I used to make some pixel art back in high school, and gobou, a creator on YouTube, was one of the creators whose work I used as a reference. Over the last 9 years, gobou has put out 24 pixel art videos featuring characters from Yume Nikki, and has had a pretty massive effect on the fanbase, with their most popular videos reaching millions of views.

I watched this recent upload of theirs (https://youtu.be/8l1zY5ndOXI) and decided to read more about the game itself since I wasn't really familiar with it.

One of the most prevalent visual themes in the game is that of Indigenous imagery, from cultures including the Paracas, Nazca, Aztec, Rapa Nui, and various African imagery. 
https://yumenikki.fandom.com/wiki/Indigenous_Imagery
There are various theories related to this imagery in-game that are pretty interesting to read about, but I wanted to learn more about Paracas culture itself, so I decided to listen to some traditional music from the Andes, leading me to that great album on rec 1208.

Taquirari is a musical tradition developed by the indigenous peoples of eastern Bolivia. The genre is thought to have originated within the Moxo culture in the northeastern region of the country (the current Beni Department) being also an established tradition in the rural areas of Santa Cruz. Like other genres from that area, it combines indigenous and Hispanic elements. It might have originated as a form of Moxo ritual music to invoke the god of hunting. After the Spanish colonization, the genre expanded beyond its ceremonial setting as popular form of dance music in the region, thus becoming part of the Bolivian creole culture.

Traditional instrumentation includes handheld drums (bombo, caja) and flutes (quena), as well as the charango, a small creolized guitar considered the national instrument of Bolivia. Taquiraris are pentatonic, which suggests cultural exchange with Indigenous Andean Music, especially Huayno.

During the 19th century, the genre spread to the northern regions of Chile, Argentina and Uruguay; many famous taquirari perfomances and compositions have been done by artists from these regions including Alfredo Zitarrosa and Horacio Guarany. Bolivian singer/songwriter Matilde Casazola is an important exponent of the genre in its native country, and Percy Ávila was one of the most prolific composers. The first group to popularize the genre across Bolivia was Las Kantutas, a female duo from La Paz that played live on the radio and recorded several singles during the 1940s. In the late 1960s, Los Jairas kept the style in vogue, and today many traditional ensembles continue to play taquiraris.

It's difficult to find a high-quality recording of traditional Taquirari. Here are some less traditional works that take influence from the genre:

Carnaval cruceño (or simply “carnaval") is a danceable genre, similar to the Polka, from the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra in Bolivia’s tropical east. As its name suggests, it is the characteristic music of the area’s Carnival celebrations. Carnavales are generally composed for brass band musicians.

Carnaval was the first form of música oriental to gain popularity outside of the eastern lowlands. Rhythmically, carnavales feature the sesquiáltera hemiola (interplay between 6/8 and 3/4 meters), a Spanish colonial legacy also found in Cuecas and bailecitos. Whereas Bolivian cuecas and bailecitos follow AABA sectional form, though, AABB or AABBCC represent the standard setups for carnavales (as well as for Bolivian Huayños and many other Bolivian genres). Melodically, most carnaval tunes adhere to the major mode.

1217:
Harawi or arawi is one of the oldest surviving genres of Indigenous Andean Music. It is a strictly monophonic style of sung poetry performed by women known as harawiq whose vocals are particularly nasal and high-pitched. Each song consists a repeating musical phrase with prominent glissandi and melismata. Themes are very emotional, often including unrequited love and death, which explains the profound and soulful tone of the music. During pre-Columbian times, the genre was present in most Inca rituals and ceremonies, but after the Spanish colonization its popularity began to decline. By the 19th century, the genre was already eclipsed by its mestizo derivation, Yaraví, a popular genre that includes prominent aspects of Hispanic American Music. Nonetheless, the genre continues to have some influence on contemporary musicians as exemplified by Olivier Messiaen's 1945 classical work Harawi. Furthermore, some artists continue to create harawi music to this day.

1218:
Yaraví 

Yaraví is a traditional folk genre developed in Peruvian criollo-mestizo society in the late colonial era, most likely in the Cuzco area. Usually in 6/8 meter (although Bolivian yaravís often are in 2/4 or 4/4), it is characterized by recurring themes of sadness and unrequited love.

Bolivian indigenist writers often consider the yaraví to be derived from a pre-Columbian genre, the Harawi. Peruvian scholars, though, have discredited this scenario. In any case, by the mid-1800s Peru’s yaraví tradition had spread not only to Bolivia but also to Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, and Uruguay.

The yaraví entered the repertoire of Bolivian criollo-mestizo musicians in the 19th century, with the serenade representing a key performance context in urban La Paz. Befitting this social function, and in accordance with the yaraví's alternate name of triste (“sad”), musicians traditionally perform the genre at a languid tempo, while the texts they interpret typically convey sorrowful emotions.

Zamacueca is a traditional genre and dance that originated in the Black community of 19th century coastal Peru. It is a courtship dance in which partners flirted with each other while surrounded by a crowd of onlookers who sang, played instruments, clapped, and shouted words of encouragement. Zamacueca is sung in the minor mode and musically accompanied by a varying combination of guitar, vihuela, harp and cajón.

The dance gained a great deal of popularity during the early nineteenth century, thereafter developing a number of variants that were practiced by Criollo-Mestizo populations not only in Peru but also other parts of Latin America. Throughout the Spanish American wars of independence, as each republic broke off and formed its own identity, these adaptations were given status of national dance and changed the dance’s name over time (such as Zamba in Argentina, Cueca in Bolivia and Chile, and Marinera in Peru). 
There are several discrepancies about cueca origins, but is believed to be derived from the Peruvian zamacueca. Zamacueca was developed during the early 19th century, its main influences are probably Spanish fandango and jota, although it also bears similarities with Spanish-Arabic zambra and African, criollo and Amerindian dances. Zamacueca evolved in Chile into "chilena", a faster and more lively style of dance and music, which was eventually renamed as cueca (in Peru was renamed as Marinera, with a much slower tempo).


I'll talk about the other genres later. For now I'll just talk about Bolivian Cueca.


1219:
Cueca

There are several discrepancies about cueca origins, but is believed to be derived from the Peruvian zamacueca. Zamacueca was developed during the early 19th century, its main influences are probably Spanish fandango and jota, although it also bears similarities with Spanish-Arabic zambra and African, criollo and Amerindian dances. Zamacueca evolved in Chile into "chilena", a faster and more lively style of dance and music, which was eventually renamed as cueca (in Peru was renamed as Marinera, with a much slower tempo).

Cueca music is played with a 6/8 or 3/4 time signatures, is usually structured into 14 verses and the dance it resembles a parody of the courtship movements between a hen ("gallina clueca" in Spanish, hence the name "cueca") and a rooster. There are several variations of cueca, the Chilean one is arguably the most popular style, and is the official national dance in Chile since 1979. The four main variations of cueca in Chile are: cueca nortina (mainly instrumental and played with a fast rhythm), cueca brava (urban, the most modern version of cueca), cueca campesina ("peasant cueca", the most traditional style of cueca) and cueca chilota (which gives more emphasis to the vocal parts). There are also many significant variations of cueca in Argentina, Bolivia and Mexico (where it evolved into Chilena).

Marinera

Marinera is the name of a coastal dance, as well as it's musical component, which is often considered the national dance of Peru.

With different origin theories spawning from Peruvian, African, and Spanish proposals, marinera's true conception is undetermined. Some specialists agree that it originated from the ancient musical style and dance of the Viceroyalty of Peru, zamacueca.

Different schools and styles of marineras exist, some of them being marinera norteña (marinera from the north), marinera limeña (marinera from Lima), and marinera serrana (marinera from the highlands).

Regardless of style, the common musical accompaniment of marineras is traditionally made of a group of 4 guitars and the cajón. It is typical for two of the guitar players to also play the role of singers.

1221:
Conjunto Andino 

Conjuntos Andinos are urban folk ensembles featuring Andean Indigenous instruments like the zampoña, kena, charango, and bombo, typically comprised of four to six musicians. Their repertoire encompasses diverse genres such as Huayno, Cueca, and more, often performed at folk shows. Originating from Criollo and Mestizo artists, this tradition gained international prominence in the 1950s and 1960s through Argentine bands like Los Incas and Los Calchakis, who introduced stylized Andean music to European audiences. Chilean groups like Inti-Illimani and Quilapayún continued this trend in the 1970s.

In Bolivia, the Conjunto Andino format became popular in the late 1960s, with influential ensembles like Los Jairas playing a pivotal role. Despite its association with leftist politics in Chile and elsewhere in Latin America, Bolivians viewed Conjunto Andino as a national expression rooted in criollo-mestizo folk music, distinct from the Pan-Latin Americanist ideologies. This nuanced understanding reflects differing cultural perceptions of Conjunto Andino across the Andean region.

1222:
Caporal 

Caporal is a Bolivian neofolkloric dance music known for its double beat bass drum pattern, emerging in the latter half of the twentieth century.

Its roots lie in an Andean criollo-mestizo parade form that satirizes Afro-Bolivian expressive practices, known variably in Bolivia as tundiqui, tuntuna, and negritos. In 1969, Los Jairas adapted it to the Conjunto andino style, becoming the first group to do so with "San Benito," featured on the 1969 LP Bolivia Con Los Jairas. Chile’s Inti-Illimani incorporated it into their repertoire after hearing it in La Paz in 1970. Concurrently, Los Payas popularized the genre in Bolivia during the 1970s, preferring the term "tuntuna."

In the 1980s, a new version, danza de los caporales, gained popularity in Bolivian entrada scenes, featuring flashier dance steps and attire. The musical element was often termed saya or saya caporal, frustrating Afro-Bolivians due to its lack of resemblance to Afro-Bolivian Saya.

Los Kjarkas (who I also featured on rec 1212) introduced caporal with "Llorando se fue" on their 1982 album Canto a la mujer de mi pueblo. Despite recording seven albums between 1983 and 1990, they produced only three additional caporales until the Lambada craze of 1989. This prompted greater attention to caporal, making it a staple genre for Los Kjarkas and other conjuntos andinos.

In 1984, a Peruvian group, Cuarteto Continental, produced the first upbeat version of the song, speeding up the rhythm. The rights were then purchased by Brazilian singer Marcia Ferreira, who sped up the song even more, incorporating the accordion used on the Cuarteto track, and singing it in Portuguese as "Chorando Se Foi". This was then covered by the French-Brazilian band Kaoma, whose 1989 version titled "Lambada" sold 15 million copies around the world. The producers were then sued successfully by Los Kjarkas when it was found that they didn't properly credit nor get permission to publish.

Throughout the 1990s, Thai, Hindi, and Cantonese covers of the songs were released by various artists, and in January 2011, Puerto Rican artist Don Omar released a fast-paced, Reggaeton song, "Taboo" which samples the Kaoma and Ferreira versions in the chorus and the bridge. One month later, Jennifer Lopez's "On The Floor" (ft. Pitbull) was released, incorporating the sample in the hook and the song's intro. "On The Floor" went on to sell 11 million records worldwide.

Chuntunqui romántico

Chuntunqui romántico is a vibrant Bolivian genre set in 6/8 meter featuring choral refrains, harmonic progressions, and lyrics exploring the subject of romantic love. It is derived from the original chuntunqui that Chuquisaca musicians traditionally perform at Christmastime.

In the late 1960s, Ernesto Cavour, renowned charango player and member of the folk ensemble Los Jairas, composed an instrumental piece titled "Chuntunqui.” 
https://youtu.be/2c8oNXnsThY

This led to chuntunqui being incorporated into the neofolklore music of Kjarkas, a prominent ensemble influenced by balada latinoamericana- the post-1960s Latin American iteration of the Bolero tradition. The song "Pequeño amor" became a hit and marked the genre's evolution into a love song with an Andean flair.

The popularity of chuntunqui expanded beyond Bolivia, reaching countries like Peru, Ecuador, and Chile, where it resonated with young audiences. The genre became an emblem of youth identity, blending Andean heritage with the experiences of modern society. By the 1980s, chuntunqui became a Conjunto andino staple for Bolivian bands, as well as for non-Bolivian groups of this variety.

Rie Kugimiya is a Japanese voice actress and singer. She is best known for her voice performances in anime, which include Alphonse Elric in the Fullmetal Alchemist series, Kagura in Gin Tama, and Happy in Fairy Tail and Edens Zero.

Some of her fans have nicknamed her the "Queen of Tsundere."

Her fans have described something called "kugimiya disease." I'm not gonna try to explain it but it's kind of funny. Here's an English 2008 blogpost about it.

Spiritual jazz is a style of Jazz music which emerged in the 1960s. It is closely associated with the musical and spiritual philosophy developed by John Coltrane in the mid-1960s (manifested as early as his seminal A Love Supreme album) which was passed on to his collaborators Alice Coltrane and Pharoah Sanders.

Stylistically, spiritual jazz is marked by a mixture of jazz with approximations of ethnic music styles (often a blend of styles evocative of African, Indian, and East Asian musical traditions), religious music of non-Christian traditions, and the ecstatic, transcendental aspects of Free Jazz. This radical style was closely linked to various African-American political and spiritual movements, such as the Nation of Islam and Afro-Centrism, the introduction of Zen philosophy and yoga in America, a resurgence of Egyptology, as well as the Civil Rights and Black Power movements. 

Pharoah Sanders (1940 – 2022) was an American jazz saxophonist. Known for his distinctive saxophone playing, as well as his use of "sheets of sound", Sanders played a prominent role in the development of free jazz and spiritual jazz through his work as a member of John Coltrane's groups in the mid-1960s, and later through his solo work. He released more than thirty albums as a leader and collaborated extensively with others. Fellow saxophonist Ornette Coleman once described him as "probably the best tenor player in the world".

Sanders' take on "spiritual jazz" was rooted in his inspiration from religious concepts such as Karma and Tawhid, and his rich, meditative performance aesthetic. This style was seen as a continuation of Coltrane's work on albums such as A Love Supreme (rec 245). As a result, Sanders was considered to have been a disciple of Coltrane.

Here's his 1969 album Karma
https://youtu.be/2t88stnbP0g

Promises is a 2021 collaboration album by electronic music producer Floating Points, jazz saxophonist Pharoah Sanders, and The London Symphony Orchestra
https://youtu.be/Mn8x0QbN4f8

A continuous piece of orchestral music in nine movements for saxophone, strings, keyboards and electronics, composed by Sam Shepherd. I consider it to be a masterpiece of orchestral-electronic collaboration, and it may be my favorite Jazz or Jazz-adjacent album ever. Certainly my favorite from the past 3 decades.

This was the last album Pharoah Sanders worked on. An instant Post-Minimalism/Third Stream classic. Meditative, ethereal, lush, and beautiful. Incredibly well-recorded.

As with a lot of orchestral music, I'd recommended listening through from start to finish without pause. This album demands my full attention, and that's what I try to give it. For me, a great way to make 45 minutes feel like 10.

1229:
American primitivism is a musical style originated by guitarist John Fahey in the late 1950s. American primitive guitar is characterized by blending avant-garde and neo-classical compositions with traditional Country Blues fingerpicking techniques. Another distinct feature of this genre is incorporation of raga structure taken from Hindustani Classical Music (see rec 756). American primitivism is primarily instrumental, though artists such as Robbie Basho included vocals in their music. This style was a major component of Fahey's Takoma Records label.

Fahey's own term "American primitive guitar" is nowadays often seen in analogy to "primitivism" in visual arts, a fascination of European painters and sculptors with the art of (ethnocentrically speaking) 'primitive' cultures, from 1890 onwards. This analogy has at least two aspects: first, Fahey himself directly refers to the untutored, auto-didactic quality of French primitivist painter Henri Rousseau's work. Secondly, like primitivism in visual arts, American primitive guitar tries to incorporate powerful, raw and authentic elements of 'primitive' music, but uses these elements for its own purposes and with little regard to other current art or music more affiliated with 'high culture'.

Here's John Fahey's 1973 album  Fare Forward Voyagers (Soldier's Choice) 
https://youtu.be/KrMuPhqRzZg

A nice meditative acoustic album that features impressive dynamic and technical guitar playing.

Young Scrolls is a musical artist and project that aims to parody or adapt the Elder Scrolls video game series by mixing it with modern real-life tropes, like pop music or internet memes.

Started in 2016, the project was originally known for creating songs with lyrics produced by “sentence mixing” the games' original voice lines, but would become later on a cross-medium effort. The project started with EDM and synthwave, moving on to hip hop.

Unironically really great music. His knowledge of the elder scrolls lore is incorporated so well its crazy

Here are some of his longer releases and their concepts:

JIUB - SAINT features Jiub, a character from Morrowind and later a saint of the Tribunal Temple and the New Temple. He was canonized for driving the cliff racers from the island of Vvardenfell in Morrowind.
https://youtu.be/rTeVz6rP6r4 (released 2019)

GLARTHIR - NUTTY features Glarthir, a minor character from Oblivion who believes that he is constantly being watched and conspired against. He believes that Bernadette Peneles, Toutius Sextius, and Davide Surilie are in on the plot against him.
https://youtu.be/cnffv5aNqgw (released 2022)

SHEOGORATH - ZOOM features Sheogorath, a recurring character from the games. The Daedric Prince of Madness. His realm in Oblivion is known as the Shivering Isles, separated into two distinct communities: Mania, the fantastic, colorful side, where art enthusiasts and insane revelers reside, and Dementia, the horrific, dark and ominous side, inhabited by those with the darker side of Sheogorath's blessings.
https://youtu.be/RPxvTd_jCPQ (released 2018)

He also released his Bards College EP 2 weeks ago, featuring teachers and students from Skyrim's Bards College.

Just a couple of days ago he released LORKHAN, a complete reimagining of Skyrim's soundtrack.

LORKHAN is a deliberate departure from Jeremy Soule's style, with decidedly less ambient instrumentation, providing a different gameplay feel. Pieces have been composed to enhance and recontextualise special or one-off scenes in the game.

LORKHAN attempts to bring greater variety and distinct character to different regions of the game with respect to their cultures and inspirations while avoiding obvious anachronisms:

-Mainland Skyrim features the sounds of the tagelharpa, a Scandinavian staple, as well as the viola da gamba, hoarse violins, fiddles and cellos, and rumbling male choirs. Whiterun wakes up to the sound of kulning, while throat singing can be heard in the corners of the Reach. Music for the major cities is minimalistic, almost melding with the ambience. The music mirrors Skyrim's modern history, and Imperial influence is still audible within.
-The Forgotten Vale is flooded with solemn elven voices and distant bells - remnants of an extinct culture.
-The halls of Castle Volkihar echo with haunting organs and cellos.
-Solstheim is a far cry from civilisation, where nature reigns supreme. Its soundtrack is less melodic, focusing on drones, drums and chants. Southern Solstheim features a new soundtrack carefully crafted in an attempt to more accurately portray the despair and hope of the Dunmer people, loosely inspired by the music of the Middle East, Mesopotamia and East Asia and featuring the duduk, erhu and setar.
-The Soul Cairn is chaos of wailing horns, and Apocrypha (which had no unique music prior) takes on an otherworldly and synthy sound.
-Additional optional music for Creation Club dungeons drowns The Cause and Saints & Seducers in drones and reverberating harps, while Umbra receives unique music for its boss fight.

I havent finished listening through this yet, but what I've heard has been extremely impressive

Mecano was a Spanish pop band formed in 1981 and active until 1992. Mecano became one of the most successful Spanish pop bands of all time. The band is still the best-selling Spanish band, with over 20 million records worldwide. They were considered by some to be avant-garde for their time and part of la Movida Madrileña countercultural movement. They had a brief comeback in 1998.

The band's line-up consisted of singer Ana Torroja and brothers Nacho and José María Cano, who worked alongside session musicians such as Arturo Terriza, Manolo Aguilar, Nacho Mañó, Javier Quílez, Ángel Celada and Óscar Astruga. The trio's musical career spanned two distinct stages. The first, up to 1985, was essentially as a synthpop band, while in the second stage Mecano followed a more acoustic pop rock direction, with elements of ballad, dance, flamenco, bossa nova, tango, salsa, rumba flamenca, bolero, pasodoble, and even reggae.

The unprecedented success also hit Hispanic America. Also, thanks to adaptations to other languages of several of their songs, they influenced non-Spanish speaking countries such as Italy and France, as with their song "Une femme avec une femme". In 2005, Mecano's music was adapted into the successful musical Hoy no me puedo levantar, which opened productions in Spain and Mexico. After two years, it was announced that the musical had been seen by more than 1,500,000 spectators in both countries, making it the most successful original production in Spanish of all time. 

Here's their 1987 Art Pop single Hijo de la Luna

A little extra info: La Movida Madrileña, was a countercultural movement that took place mainly in Madrid during the Spanish transition to democracy after the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975. The Concierto homenaje a Canito, which took place on February 9, 1980, is traditionally considered the beginning of La Movida Madrileña.

La Movida Madrileña featured a rise in punk rock and synth-pop music, an openness regarding sexual expression and drug usage, and the emergence of new dialects such as cheli. This hedonistic cultural wave started in Madrid before appearing in other Spanish cities such as Barcelona, Bilbao and Vigo.


Hijo de la Luna kind of reminds me of 2014 French Pop single Love Story, by Indila. I'm not sure if it was influenced directly by Mecano. Either way, both songs are somewhat nostalgic for me. Surprising that they were released almost 3 decades apart

Leslie Feist, known mononymously as Feist, is a Canadian and American indie pop singer-songwriter and guitarist, performing both as a solo artist and as a member of the indie rock group Broken Social Scene. Feist launched her solo music career in 1999 with the release of Monarch.

She has received 11 Juno Awards (Canada's most prestigious music award), including two Artist of the Year awards.

Here's 1,2,3,4, a 2007 single from Feist 
https://youtu.be/sijSh4tMPVg

This song became a surprise hit after being featured in a commercial for the iPod nano, hitting No. 8 in the US, a rare feat for indie rock musicians and even more notable since it hit the Top Ten on the strength of downloads alone. Feist won a Juno Award for the single as "Single of the Year". 

Feist performed an alternate version of "1234" on Sesame Street during its 39th season (2008), teaching children to count to the number four. She said working with the Muppets was a career highlight.

Lullatone is a Japanese musical duo based in Nagoya, whose music is characterized by an innocent, childlike quality and lo-fi sounds. The group refers to their style of music as "pajama-pop", and can be described as Indietronica. 

Thinking About Thursdays was a project where Lullatone would write and release a song each Thursday of the year. 

Their own description: "Imagined as a type of instrumental audio journal, the album finds the duo traveling around the world - writing songs on airplanes to Korea, giving bad Valentine's Day presents, giving up on other New Year's resolutions, and catching the cherry blossoms back in Japan all through their optimistic outlook and sense of melody."

I'd recommend listening to this somewhere else other than YouTube to be able to see the track titles.
https://youtu.be/lP2qp59J5Jc

The quality of each track is a little inconsistent, as can be expected from a project of this nature. Still, it's an interesting project with some fun ideas.

Leonard Norman Cohen CC GOQ was a Canadian singer-songwriter, poet, and novelist. Themes commonly explored throughout his work include faith and mortality, isolation and depression, betrayal and redemption, social and political conflict, and sexual and romantic love, desire, regret, and loss. He was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He was invested as a Companion of the Order of Canada, the nation's highest civilian honour. In 2011, he received one of the Prince of Asturias Awards for literature and the ninth Glenn Gould Prize.

Here's are a few songs from his debut album, Songs of Leonard Cohen (1967)
https://youtu.be/svitEEpI07E
https://youtu.be/VDBp8xBTO0Y
https://youtu.be/frWZSAZWs1g

This album is ranked #5 for 1967, #91 overall on RYM. Considered by many to be among the best Contemporary Folk and Singer-Songwriter albums of all time. 

Cohen demonstrates his mastery as a poet here, where the spotlight is perhaps more on the characters and narratives than the music itself.

Continuing from the previous rec,

Here's Leonard Cohen's most famous work, Hallelujah. Originally released on his album Various Positions (1984)
https://youtu.be/ttEMYvpoR-k

Over 4 to 5 years, Cohen is reputed to have written around 80 to as many as 180 draft verses for "Hallelujah"—a number affected by the accounting question that he had many versions of the same line. In a writing session in New York's Royalton Hotel, Cohen is famously said to have been reduced to sitting on the floor in his underwear, filling notebooks, banging his head on the floor.


"You Want It Darker," Cohen's 2016 album, is an introspective exploration of mortality, spirituality, humor, and the human experience. It was produced near the end of his life when he was around 82. 

Here's the title track

I've talked about Deconstructed House briefly before, but here's a more full description:

In the 2010s, producers and DJs merged global rhythms like Trap, Ballroom, Batida, Jersey Club, and Grime with abrasive Post-Industrial sounds, creating deconstructed club. This genre often incorporates themes tied to race, feminism, queer politics, colonialism, futurism, and technology. Identified by frantic, metallic percussion and samples like glass smashing and gunshots, deconstructed club creates an apocalyptic soundscape with constant rhythmic changes and atonality.

Free DJ mixes or mixtapes, known as mixfiles, are crucial to deconstructed club. These mixfiles can champion marginalized cultures by showcasing a remixed plethora of regional sounds underrepresented in English-speaking countries.

Deconstructed club also often involves reworked Pop songs into "bootlegs," using online rips of vocal stems and sound clips from action movies. Crampton coined the term severo to describe music inspired by family networks and communities seeking transformative justice.

Various terms have emerged to describe different shades of deconstructed club music. "Club-not-club" nights in Philadelphia mixed R&B and Pop Rap with Noise and cinematic soundscapes, while "angelwave" in Moscow featured euphoric deconstructed Trance. Deconstructed club has also lent inspiration to other genres, such as in Neoperreo giving Reggaetón a futuristic mood, Weightless taking apart the rhythms of Grime, and Hyperpop often featuring metallic percussion


Here's Tidal Memory Exo, a 2024 album (released last week) by Iglooghost (see rec 369).

It's got a mechanical, futuristic, and atmospheric feel. Having heard his earlier work, it's interesting to see him move in a heavier, almost cyberpunk-oriented direction compared to his lighthearted and quirky feel of Neō Wax Bloom. Extremely well-produced.

Epic collage is a term coined by musicologist Adam Harper to describe the digital collage-like musical form of prominent producer Elysia Crampton and her affiliates through NON Worldwide. Despite utilizing the thematic elements of Deconstructed Club as well as adopting its abrasive sonic palette through its direct concurrence with contemporary Post-Industrial music, epic collages are not necessarily beat-driven or club-oriented and favour a more sprawling cinematic approach which may more accurately resemble genres such as Ambient, Glitch, Noise, New Age, Cinematic Classical, Nature Recordings, or Progressive Electronic.

An epic collage may draw upon elements of Spoken Word, Poetry, or Radio Drama which is most frequently exhibited through the use of text-to-speech transcription, clips of spoken ASMR, and samples from various pop media. Epic collage artists are also commonly defined by their ability to decontextualize recognizable samples and provide them with a seemingly conflicting sonic backdrop which thusly results in a Mashup (or mess-up) that strives to be greater than the sum of its parts, oftentimes conveying gravitas as opposed to the levitas of a more conventional mashup (though perhaps a blurring of the lines between the two).

Here's DJ E, a 2023 album by Chuquimamani-Condori. It also belongs to the Latin Electronic (or Latintronica) movement.

Latin Electronic combines Electronic music with Latin American music influences that started at the end of the 1990s. Specific scenes like Digital Cumbia and Nortec developed around Buenos Aires and Tijuana, respectively, but this also encompasses a wider array of genre mixtures. 

The album is dense but ethereal. Some of the tracks are noisier than others. It's interesting; cluttered and blended though it is, it's still got a unique, cohesive sound that allows individual samples to shine through. I'm not familiar with Andean pop but still found the sampling enjoyable.

Emerging from South Africa in the early 1990s, Kwaito is a music genre that takes influence from Disco, Hip Hop, and - most obviously - American and British House music. Its songs usually feature deep basslines, looped samples from more traditional styles of African music, and often sung or rapped vocals, which are usually male.

Gqom is a musical genre that evolved from South African House music in late 2000s, specifically Kwaito, and is often described as a more minimal and raw version, stripped down to only include the beat. The main difference is Gqom's syncopated rhythm used instead of the Kwaito's 4/4 time signature.

Here's a lovely contemporary classical composition I heard performed at a recent live NAC broadcast

Gumboots by David Bruce 
https://youtu.be/rRIDt_4Xloc

Bruce wrote this about his composition:
There is a paradox in music, and indeed all art - the fact that life-enriching art has been produced, even inspired by conditions of tragedy, brutality and oppression, a famous example being Messiaen's Quartet for the End of Time, written while he was in a prisoner of war camp. Gumboot Dancing bears this trait - it was born out of the brutal labour conditions in South Africa under Apartheid, in which black miners where chained together and wore Gumboots (wellington boots) while they worked in the flooded gold mines, because it was cheaper for the owners to supply the boots than to drain the floodwater from the mine. Apparently slapping the boots and chains was used by the workers as a form of communication which was otherwise banned in the mine, and this later developed into a form of dance. It is characterised by a huge vitality and zest for life. So this for me is a striking example of how something beautiful and life-enhancing can come out of something far more negative.

My 'Gumboots' is in two parts of roughly equal length, the first is tender and slow moving, at times 'yearning'; at times seemingly expressing a kind of tranquility and inner peace. The second is a complete contrast, consisting of five lively 'gumboot dances', often joyful and always vital.

However, although there are some African music influences in the music, I don't see the piece as being specifically 'about' the Gumboot dancers, if anything it could be seen as an abstract celebration of the rejuvinating power of dance, moving as it does from introspection through to celebration. I would like to think however, that the emotional journey of the piece, and specifically the complete contrast between the two halves will force the listener to conjecture some kind of external 'meaning' to the music.

The Apothecary Diaries was my second favorite anime of last year, after Frieren. This was majorly due to it's soundtrack, composed by Alisa Okehazama (known for JJK), Satoru Kōsaki (known for Beastars) and Kevin Penkin (my favorite soundtrack composer who I've already talked about like 10 times on here)

No idea who decided to put these three together, but it worked out perfectly.

My favorites from the OST did end up being by Kevin Penkin, unsuprisingly, but all of them did a great job.

Here are some of my favorites from just Penkin:

The next rew recs will be on Funk Brasileiro

Funk brasileiro, known primarily as "funk" in Brazil, is a Hip Hop-influenced music genre originating from Rio de Janeiro's shanty towns (also known as favelas). Originally rooted in Electro and Miami Bass, Funk carioca developed into a distinctive style and has since established itself as one of the most popular music genres among Brazil's lower-class youths.

Since the 1970s, dance parties known as bailes funk were held in Rio de Janeiro by DJs like Big Boy & Ademir Lemos and sound teams such as Furacão 2000 and Cashbox, usually playing US Funk and Soul music. By the 1980s, with the decline of funk, those parties began playing more electro and hip hop-based music, especially Miami bass. Eventually, Brazilian DJs started making their own Portuguese versions of Miami bass songs, with D.J. Marlboro apresenta Funk Brasil and Equipe Super Quente being the first releases in that style. In 1990 MC Batata's "Feira de Acarí / Conselho" became the first national funk hit in Brazil.


1248:
Beat bolha (“bubble beat” in Portuguese) is a style of Funk brasileiro defined by its squeaky wisps and chopped bubbling noises, usually played around 130 to 170 BPM. The genre grew out as a fairly known microgenre in Rio de Janeiro's Baixada Fluminense in the late-2010s using bubbling loops, adapting the late Funk carioca trademarks to minimal and Electronic-led tendencies, as on DJ MERINHO and DJ CARETA RLK's YouTube sets. The sound would continue to evolve in the early-2020s with the popularization of Funk 150 bpm in Rio de Janeiro's funk scene, mainly pushed by DJ Ramon Sucesso's frenetic and unpredictable skills with the MIDI controller in mini-sets on fridays, known as Sexta dos crias, that went viral online as a meme during the 2020's pandemic.

The hybridization with funk 150 bpm and other Electronic Dance Music, often referred as tambor bolha, was the turning point for the genre’s development and popularity peak, adding a hyperactive and rawer sound that later would explore even harsher and distorted sampling with turntable scratches, borrowing some Beat bruxaria manipulation techniques. Despite its name, the sonic pallet would cross over diverse sampling, within the modern montagem (mixing in Portuguese) format (MTG acronym), in which the DJ is the focus instead of the MC, while merging trends from other Southeastern Brazilian states, including São Paulo's Funk mandelão, Minas Gerais' Funk de BH and Espírito Santo's Beat fino.

1249:
Emerging from the Rio de Janeiro Funk brasileiro scene in the mid-to-late-2010s, funk 150 bpm is a Rio-born development of funk carioca characterized by fast tempos, typically reaching 150 bpm and sometimes beyond it, heightened energy, and typically faster flows as well. Due to some early producers' tendency to create the genre by speeding up existing funk tracks, certain songs of the genre also tended to have more high-pitched, distorted, "squirrel"-like rapping. It's also further distinguished from the dominant São Paulo sound by being less melodic, more "wonky" and less accessible than the poppy, catchy sounds of Funk ostentação.

The genre was initially pioneered by DJ Polyvox, who was originally inspired by the sound of his son drumming with a bottle of Coca-Cola, which he found interesting and attempted to recreate in his music. It wasn't until the later works of artists like DENNIS, that the sound began to gain prominence. Dennis' remix of MC Kevin o Chris's "Medley da gaiola (DENNIS Remix)" became nationally popular in Brazil, which influenced later artists to also begin makin tracks in the 150 bpm style. Producers are also seen as more important in 150 bpm compared to other funk scenes. The aforementioned funkeiro MC Kevin, and funkeira Rebecca, became the two most prominent artists of this later wave, with hits such as, respectively, "Ela é do tipo" and "Ao som do 150". 150 bpm is also seen as a re-awakening of Rio's funk scene after the end of its social crisis, and the long period during which São Paulo's funk scene led the genre.

1250:
Funk proibidão, translated as "prohibited funk", is a style of Funk carioca that developed in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro in the 1990s, bearing resemblance to Gangsta Rap. Its development came as gangs began sponsoring funk MCs to promote their gang, target other gangs, or eulogize fallen gang members with their lyrics. Musically, the style is known for its heavy, raw, distorted production and widespread use of gunshot sound effects as percussion. In addition, lyrics are also often in call-and-response format.

The name "proibidão" comes from the Brazilian government's prohibition of music with violent or pro-crime lyrics from radio play, making most proibidão songs illegal to broadcast through radio. Because of this, proibidão is most commonly performed at gang-sponsored dances and parties called bailes. Due to the gangs' exclusive and territorial nature, MCs associated with each gang tend to develop their own unique sound that becomes associated with that gang.

Until the early 2000s, proibidão was relatively underground, as the radio ban limited the spread and popularity of the genre. However, as access to the internet has increased, proibidão MCs have taken to online platforms to share their music, allowing the genre to become more widespread and increase in popularity. Despite this, the genre remains fairly unknown outside of Brazilian favelas.

Funk carioca is a form of Brazilian Music that first emerged in the 1980s. Born in Rio de Janeiro, the style was named after the people of Rio, who are known as cariocas in Brazil. Funk carioca remained mostly limited to the Rio scene throughout the 1990s, but it would receive national popularity and spread to other regions during the 2000s, leading to a diversification of the genre's sound and to the development of many competing scenes, which now represent the fuller scale of a national genre known as simply "funk" or Funk brasileiro. The main scene that emerged to rival Rio would be that of São Paulo, which became a leading force in funk during the 2010s. Funk carioca's sound has shifted and morphed throughout the decades.

First emerging as a Brazilian take on Miami Bass and Electro productions, funk carioca initially grew as a homemade take on American 1980s Hip Hop trends, gradually suiting the production to fit the MCing styles that developed Rio de Janeiro. The style became more distinct in the 1990s with the added influence of local styles and instruments, like the implementation of the Tamborzão beat, incorporating Afro-Brazilian drums like the atabaque. More complex rhythms soon found their place, leading and the earlier Miami bass and electro elements would become absent from most funk production by the mid-2000s. Raw, simplistic approaches to production, including beats made from beatboxing loops, or more synthetic, and minimal, electronically-produced styles, were espoused by artists as well.

Funk ostentação is a subgenre of Funk brasileiro that began in the late 2000s in the region of São Paulo metro area and the Baixada Santista in São Paulo state.

The genre emerged essentially after 2008, with MCs such as Backdi & BioG3 and MC Boy do Charmes gaining popularity within the São Paulo suburbs after the promotion of local funk festivals. In 2012, funk ostentação artist MC Daleste was shot on stage during a show in Campinas, São Paulo state, an event that garnered much media attention and furthered the exposure of the genre.

Funk ostentação is mainly influenced by Hip Hop, especially Pop Rap, and typically has a more pop-oriented sonority than other styles of funk brasileiro. Lyrically, funk ostentação often centers around women, money, consumer goods, and references to clothing, beverages, and motorcycle and car brands. Aesthetically, it is heavily influenced by Gangsta Rap.

Music videos are important, even essential, to the popularity of a funk ostentação track. KondZilla, one of the most relevant artists in the scene, acts as a director and producer for funk ostentação music videos. His YouTube channel, Canal KondZilla, is the most subscribed-to channel in Brazil, and is used as a platform to promote other major funk ostentação artists like MC Guimê, MC Rodolfinho, and MC Gui.

1253:
Tamborzão is a style of Funk carioca that originated around Miami Bass samples. It was born in the late 1990s and popularized in the early 2000s in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. Its origin occurred as a style renewal, almost 10 years after baile funk subculture became popular; following the exhaustion from the repetition of 1988's “8 Volt Mix” loop, associated and heavily sampled in the first wave of Miami bass and Electro in Brazil.

To infuse a more Brazilian sound into the beat, adding sensuality and a tropical groove to its dynamics, the characteristic sound incorporates atabaque and conga as its main elements. This involved experimenting with the Roland R-8 MK-II drum machine, which was used in 1997. Gradually, other elements and percussive sounds were added to the beat, spreading quickly among Rio's youth. This newer and popular style was later recognized as the well-known rhythm of funk carioca to outsiders, even resembling Samba aspects.

The first insertion of this beat was in a rap by the duo Tito e Xandão. Furacão 2000 Records played a significant role in fostering this new funk trend, bringing artists like Bonde do Tigrão to massive success with songs such as "Cerol na mão". "Injeção", by Deize Tigrona and produced by DJ Marlboro, is considered one of the forerunners of the style, which was later sampled by Diplo and even M.I.A. in "Bucky Done Gun", gaining first international attention for the Brazilian scene.

MCing about explicit themes with sexual connotation and using humorous lyrics are quite common, emerging concurrently with Funk proibidão and overlapping their Hip Hop background, such as Boladona by Tati Quebra Barraco. In the early 2010s the sound became oversaturated and began to decline due to the recent spread of Funk brasileiro in other regions of the country but went viral again in 2023, as a response to the hit “Tá OK”.

Rasteirinha is a form of music derived from Funk brasileiro, which originated in the Rio de Janeiro area during the early 2010s. It is represented by a slow pace, resting between a tempo of 90-110 BPM, blending a highly rhythmic basis with instrumentation derived from Samba and Axé music, the prominence of inspired grooves from caribbean styles such as Dancehall and Reggaetón (also having comparisons with Ragga) and the easy-going poppy driven attitude from Afrobeats.

Percussive sections are usually repetitive and manipulated as bar-long loops, involving newer beatboxing techniques and slowing down the Tamborzão derived beat of Afro-Brazilian instruments, mainly the atabaque. The term was modeled after the minimalist and slower “funk rasteiro”, an Electro-inflected style of Funk carioca born in the mid-1990s that later was named as “flashback” in retrospect.

Rasteirinha had its popularity peak during the mid-2010s thanks to influential hits "As novinha tão sensacional" by MC Romântico and "Olha a explosão" by São Paulo native MC Kevinho, but began to decline shortly after in the midst of the increasing popularity of Brega funk and Arrocha funk, other slower variations of Brazilian funk that peaked at the same period.

1255:
Emerging in the Southeast Region of Brazil in the 2010s, Arrocha funk developed in parallel to the Northeast Region's Brega funk. Contrasting the glossy and wonky sound of the latter, arrocha funk features slow and gritty Reggaetón-like drums with an emphasis on brass sections influenced by Arrocha.

The genre was pioneered in Rio de Janeiro by DJ Rennan da Penha, who produced “Arrocha da Penha” by MC Flavinho based on a bass sample and an arrocha drumbeat. The song quickly became a hit, and other artists such as DJ Guuga and MC Nando DK started to expand and spread the sound, “Troféu do ano” bringing national popularity to the genre.

By 2018, brega funk was rising in popularity and the mix of both genres started to become more common. For example, “Envolvimento” by MC Loma e as Gêmeas Lacração became a viral hit and later on “Tudo ok” by Thiaguinho MT topped the Brazilian streaming charts in 2020. As they became popular, both terms started being used interchangeably to refer to any Funk brasileiro and Brega fusion, but their sounds remained distinct.

1256:
Indie surf is a style of Indie Rock which emerged in the late 2000s, primarily in the United States. Stylistically, the genre incorporates the melodic Pop Rock sensibilities of 2000s indie rock (especially Post-Punk Revival) into a more lo-fi and reverb-drenched sound in the vein of Slacker Rock and the hazy psychedelic nostalgia of Ariel Pink's southern California Hypnagogic Pop. Its most defining feature is the influence from Surf Rock in the guitar style, present in the more uptempo Surf Punk and Garage Rock Revival oriented artists as well as the slower Dream Pop-adjacent side of the genre, though the latter also draws from the 1960s melodies of Vocal Surf by way of The Beach Boys. Beyond surf music, guitars also frequently have a jangly sound which along with indie surf's poppy melodicism link it with Jangle Pop. Aesthetically, the genre has a lot in common with its contemporary Chillwave, embracing retro graphic design and photography with a particular focus on the beach and the ocean.

Though surf influences had been incorporated in the indie scene through the lens of Psychedelic Pop by Animal Collective and their Paw Tracks label through the 2000s, the indie surf genre would not really emerge as a distinct phenomenon until 2009 and 2010. The first wave of the genre was led by groups like Real Estate, Surfer Blood, Wavves, The Drums, Beach Fossils, and Best Coast, who all released major albums during this two year period and gained coverage through the indie blogosphere. Indie surf would fade from prominence after the early 2010s, but most of these bands have continued to release music and tour, alongside newer groups like La Luz, Surf Curse, and SadGirl.

Emerging in London in the early 2000s, grime developed from UK Garage, especially 2-Step, alongside other British Electronic Dance Music genres like Drum and Bass and Jungle. Influenced by Jamaican Dancehall and American Hip Hop, grime is characterized by fast-paced, syncopated, and highly rhythmic beats around 140 BPM, often aggressive and raw. The sound intertwines with grime MCs' vocal style, featuring dark, rapid beats for lyrical delivery, though later developments saw a significant focus on instrumental tracks. Grime lyrics often address urban life, crime, social injustice, braggadocio, and rivalries between MCs.

In the early 2000s, Wiley's "Eskibeat" and Jon E Cash's "Sub-Low" marked significant developments in grime. MCs like Dizzee Rascal, Kano, Skepta, and Lethal Bizzle released influential projects, with Dizzee's "Boy in da Corner" achieving major recognition. Platforms like Grimetapes.com, radio shows, and independent DVDs played crucial roles in promoting new artists. Throughout the decade, grime experienced relative popularity, even facing mainstream media backlash. Independent developments saw grime crossing over with genres like Contemporary R&B, Electropop, and Pop Rap, as well as merging with Dubstep in Purple Sound. Grime also influenced the dubstep and UK Funky scenes.

Despite a decline in popularity in the late 2000s and early 2010s, grime continued evolving. It spawned derivatives like the experimental, instrumental Weightless genre and UK Drill, which combined Drill production with grime influences. In the mid-2010s, new artists like AJ Tracey, Stormzy, and Lady Leshurr gained success, alongside veterans such as Skepta and JME. Grime producers began incorporating Trap influences, and the genre's impact extended to the 2010s UK Afrobeats, Afroswing, and UK Dancehall scenes.

Weightless is a style of instrumental Grime that developed in the early 2010s, characterized by "weightless", sparse percussion, and atmospheric, spectral production. Tracks are usually more soundscape-oriented and less rhythm-focused than traditional grime instrumentals, occasionally bordering on Ambient music, and often incorporating UK Bass' airy, nocturnal, and sub-bass heavy sound. In 2014, key figures Mumdance and Logos established the label Different Circles for releases in their distinct style, and released Weightless Volume One, which helped coin the genre's name.

Even though, in contrast with traditional grime, weightless is a producer-centric genre, there have been several notable vocal weightless tracks, such as Novelist and Mumdance's "1 Sec" though in terms of vocal delivery the genre is usually not distinct from grime as a broader category, only occasionally being more experimental in delivery. Despite somewhat declining in popularity throughout the 2010s, weightless would sometimes remain an influence into later and concurrent styles like Deconstructed Club, Alternative R&B, and even Wave.

Broadcast were an English band formed in Birmingham in 1995 by Trish Keenan and James Cargill. Their musical style blended elements of 1960s psychedelia with early electronic music and samples from esoteric sources; it earned the band a cult following.

Keenan died unexpectedly in January 2011 of pneumonia, shortly after she had contracted swine flu while completing a tour of Australia with Broadcast.

Spell Blanket: Collected Demos 2006-2009 was recorded in 2006 - 2009 but it was released in May of 2024. 
https://youtu.be/kIgPKlWzTsQ
It's a diverse album that could be described as      
Neo-Psychedelia, Ambient Pop, and Indietronica. It's sparse, poetic, ethereal, and often pastoral.

The album is a collection of 36 tracks that represent the groundwork for their would-be fifth album. Despite the songs being demos, James Cargill’s sequencing creates a cohesive album. The tracks range from playful folk melodies to hazy shoegaze-esque demos. "Spell Blanket" is an exercise in imagination, encouraging listeners to fill in the gaps and appreciate its unfinished yet poignant form.

1262:
Trap in Electronic Dance Music (EDM) is characterized by trap hip-hop-influenced syncopated percussion with 808 samples and fast-paced hi-hats. Influences include Dubstep, Wonky, Grime, and other UK Bass trends. In the late 2010s, artists like G Jones and Kai Whiston developed an experimental side of trap, while Skeler pioneered Hardwave. RL Grime remained influential into the 2020s with annual Halloween mixes and his label, Sable Valley Records. The genre's origins trace back to artists like Lunice, Sinjin Hawke, Hudson Mohawke, and Rustie, showing notable interplay between trap and future bass.

The term "trap" was established in 2012, a breakthrough year marked by releases like the "Original Don (Flosstradamus Remix)" and TNGHT EP. Pioneers such as RL Grime, UZ, and Baauer emerged during this time. The genre's popularity surged due to Diplo's label Mad Decent, the viral success of "Harlem Shake," and YouTube channels like Trap City, All Trap Music, and Trap Nation. Early trap was characterized by a dark, minimalistic atmosphere, prominent sub-bass, frequent drops, playful vocal samples, and Dutch House-influenced synths.

Trap evolved into a broader genre with various sub-styles. Yellow Claw's Hardstyle influences led to Hard Trap, pioneered by SAYMYNAME. Carnage's Festival Trap blended Big Room House, while Slander's Heaven Trap fused trap with Festival Progressive House. Branchez and Vanic developed "chill trap," influenced by future bass, Chillstep, and Tropical House.

Trap gained mainstream popularity with producers like DJ Snake and pop crossovers such as "Dark Horse" and "Don't Let Me Down." It became popular in K-Pop with acts like BLACKPINK and influenced Hyperpop. Although rapping is typically absent in EDM trap, crossovers, including Skrillex collaborations, have occurred.

I talked about the 2001 Japanese film All About Lily Chou-Chou back on rec 655. I finally watched the movie a few weeks ago.

A hauntingly beautiful film with a soundtrack to match.
Here's the first song off Kokyu, the album I recced on 655:

I've been listening to it quite a bit recently

Opening song off the soundtrack album Breath.


Here's the singer who plays Lily Chou Chou, Salyu, and Cornelius performing Jibun ga Inai from the Ghost in the Shell OST in January of 2024.
https://youtu.be/jinsyVLUnFc

Here's the OST version.
https://youtu.be/7qM2s3l9Ca0

I recced this song on 631, but I didn't realize Salyu was the artist behind Lily Chou Chou at that point.

I think the lyrics are pretty poignant. They match the song well:

Mem mem mem mem mem mem mem mem
Mem or ies, mem or ies, mem or ies
Memories, memories, memories, memories, memories
Memories, memories, memories, memories, memories, memoriesmemoriesmemories

Disconnected memories
Flowers (birds), This is the sky
Clouds, grass, the house where I grew up
But even if I look in the photos
I'm not there anywhere
Why am I not there? Why am I not there? (x4)

Disconnected beautiful memories
Right (left), where am I?
Buildings, roads, but even if I
walk among the crowds
I'm not there anywhere
The world, the world (x4)

It continues (simply)
It is vast (the sky)
They shine (green)
The mountains and (the ocean)
The wind (from the past)
to the future (it blows)
And I am (left)
behind (all alone)

My se lf, my se lf, my se lf
My self, my self, my self, my self, my self
Myself, myself, myself, myself, myself, myself, myself, myself
myselfmyselfmyselfmyselfmyselfmyselfmyselfmyselfmyselfmyself
Why am I not there? Why am I not there? (x4)

It can be described as Electropop and EDM, with notable influences from genres like Bubblegum Bass and Electroclash.

Chamber jazz is Jazz made by mostly small acoustic-based ensembles with emphasized improvisation and influenced by Neoclassicism and Traditional Folk Music. It is often influenced by the classical music of non-Western cultures, mainly South Asian Classical Music, Persian Classical Music, and East Asian Classical Music. It is sometimes seen as Third Stream that takes a more pared-down approach, eschewing that genre's orchestral elements and opting instead for ensembles resembling those used in Chamber Music.

Classical crossover is a genre that developed as a reaction to a Western Classical Music's relative lack of popularity within mainstream audiences. It aims to take specific western classical conventions and apply them into a straightforward Pop context to attract outside audiences. Crossover appeal can be achieved in different ways, including classical singers collaborating with pop singers or applying classical instrumentation and techniques onto pop music and vice versa. 

Commonly, classical crossover tracks include violin or cello arrangements, operatic vocal tracks, and orchestras supporting vocalists. Most examples are lush, slow-paced, and polished, with many artists releasing covers of popular songs, especially U.S. Billboard Top 40 hits. Marketing strategies often focus on holiday releases, attractive looks, age demographics, and mainstream media appearances.

The genre gained popularity after Luciano Pavarotti's performance of "Nessun Dorma" at the 1990 FIFA World Cup, which helped acts like Andrea Bocelli and Sarah Brightman popularize "operatic pop" (popera). The rise of streaming services like YouTube in the 2010s further boosted the genre, with acts like The Piano Guys, 2Cellos, and Lindsey Stirling broadening its sound.

Despite criticism for being a diluted form of classical music, many fans and artists see classical crossover as an opportunity to explore new sounds and increase interest in classical music.

Here's 新世紀への運河 (Shinseiki e no Unga), a 1988 album by ゲルニカ [Guernica]

High-energy, grandiose theatricality. 

The vocals are by Jun Togawa who I talked about on rec 1119. As always, she shows a crazy diverse range in the various voices she does, to the point where I initially thought it was different singers.

It does sound as if Susumu Hirasawa went all-in on orchestration and didn't pay attention to electronics. It makes sense that the two are friends.

I haven't had a chance to read the lyrics yet, but they seem interesting.

For instance, the first track is an orchestral biguine about magnets. Highlights of the album supposedly include:

• aforementioned biguine about magnetic attraction (and not a metaphor for love or something);
• a tone poem about life in a Soviet agricultural cooperative;
• big-band jazz about the life of a newspaper rotary press; and,
• a three-part series extolling the virtues of electricity.


1266:
Tone poem is a programmatic Orchestral Music work, usually in a single movement, that is entirely based on external non-musical themes, ideas, tales, etc. Tone poems arose at the second half of the 19th century and remained popular throughout the 20th century. The term was coined by Franz Liszt when he described his 13 orchestral works as "symphonic poems". Among other famous composers of tone poems are Claude Debussy, Hector Berlioz, Richard Strauss or Bedřich Smetana. Gustav Holst's "The Planets" is one example.

Here's another, Scheherazade, based on One Thousand and One Nights (also known as The Arabian Nights).
https://youtu.be/S50Or87VQgY
This is a 1960 performance. Composed by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and performed by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.

This orchestral work combines two features typical of Russian music in general and of Rimsky-Korsakov in particular: dazzling, colorful orchestration and an interest in the East, which figured greatly in the history of Imperial Russia, as well as orientalism in general. The name "Scheherazade" refers to the main character Scheherazade of One Thousand and One Nights. It is one of Rimsky-Korsakov's most popular works.

Kensuke Ushio is a Japanese composer, rock and EBM musician who performs under the moniker Agraph. He is a member of Japanese rock band Lama. Together with Lama, he released two full-length studio records: New! in 2011 and Modanica a year later. Both albums charted on the Oricon Albums Chart. 

Undoubtedly among my favorite soundtrack composers.

He wrote the soundtracks for Chainsaw Man, DEVILMAN crybaby, A Silent Voice, and several others. I like his music enough that I might as well split this rec into multiple.

It is primarily characterized by the distinctive, tremolo chopping of vocal samples and pads, creating a 'stuttering' gated effect reminiscent of the 'trancegate' effect commonly found in Trance music. The genre also bears significant influences from Future Garage, evident in its shuffling, bright percussion, and the use of warm synths and vocal chops, contributing to its emotional atmosphere. Stutter house usually has a tempo around 125 bpm, though certain later tracks explored higher tempos and harder beats, intersecting with Euro-Trance and hypertechno which also rose in popularity in the 2020s. Elements of stutter house can also be found in certain UK Garage and Progressive Breaks tracks of that time.

The term was coined by curator Steve Cardigan, whose playlist of similar tracks garnered significant attention, leading to its adoption on various music and social media platforms. Fred again.. is considered to be a pioneer, with his breakout track "Marea (We’ve Lost Dancing)" in particular achieving big success and popularizing the sound that would become known as stutter house. 

Here's that track, from 2021
https://youtu.be/l4UkYBr1NnA

Other notable contributors to the genre's development include BUNT. and Lavern. As stutter house gained momentum, various established artists released songs in the genre, such as ODESZA's "The Last Goodbye," Swedish House Mafia's "Ray of Solar," and The Chainsmokers' "The Fall."

I recced a couple of albums by TURQUOISEDEATH back on rec 965. Since then, they've become one of my favorite breakcore producers.

One of the timestamped tracks of Fool's Gold, Don't Look Back, is among my favorite breakcore songs.

In 2022 they also released this single, "hello?"
https://youtu.be/mi8BMN34oiQ

Maybe it's the use of samples from a few older songs and media that I recognize, but this track has a real nostalgic vibe for me.

It's their most-listened by a pretty wide margin.

Political hip hop is a style of Hip Hop that developed in the 1980s. Grandmaster Flash & The Furious Five released the first well-known Conscious Hip Hop single in 1982 called "The Message", which encouraged numerous hip hop artists to address social and political subjects. In 1988, Boogie Down Productions released the Malcolm X-inspired By All Means Necessary, the first full-length political hip hop album, dealing with topics of police corruption and the government's involvement in drug crime. Further influential releases included Public Enemy's It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back, which took a black nationalist stance, and N.W.A's "Fuck tha Police" which dealt with police brutality and racial profiling. 

Here's a track from Public Enemy's 1988 album It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back 
https://youtu.be/9vQaVIoEjOM

The musical style refers to artists who have overt political affiliations and agendas, covering all ideological stripes. As previously mentioned, black nationalist viewpoints like those of Public Enemy and Ice Cube were common in the late 80s and early 90s, while in the 2000s a wave of socialist artists like Dead Prez and Immortal Technique achieved critical recognition. In 2015, Kendrick Lamar would release the album To Pimp a Butterfly, which contained a number of political songs such as "Alright", which became a soundtrack to the Black Lives Matter movement and was chanted at protests. Run the Jewels also achieved success around the same time, with their self-described "incendiary political rhetoric" making critical and commercial waves. In the late 2010s and early 2020s, conservative hip hop began to achieve notoriety, with releases by artists such as Tom MacDonald and Forgiato Blow frequently being discussed in mainstream media and online circles.

https://youtu.be/AgvtkRGGG60

It's a nice blend of jangle and noise, and it does get surprisingly noisy at parts. It occasionally leans in a more shoegazey direction.

Very well put together, with some particularly impressive guitar performances.

I talked a bit about Sade on 693.

Here's a mashup EP between her and MF DOOM from 2016, SADEVILLAIN, by Seanh2k11. Really nice mashup. Everything works together perfectly.
https://youtu.be/RZSY9lO0S-I?t=244

MF DOOM is known to have been a big fan of Helen Folasade Adu (aka Sade), having sampled her works on several of his tracks. Doomsday, for example, is built around a large sample of Sade’s ‘Kiss of Love’.


There's also this mashup one with DOOM and Nujabes that I really like, Metaphorical Villainy, released 2020 by DJ A-OK.

Riddim is a sub-genre of Dubstep that features heavy use of repetition, wet, metallic sound design, and wobbly basses, pulling from older dubstep. The sound was first anticipated in wobble-heavy dubstep and Tearout in the late 2000s with artists such as Jakes, Kromestar and Lost, as well as other releases on Jakes' label Hench Recordings. Their influence would start to emerge into the early 2010s, with then-small dubstep producers and groups on the internet, who would distribute their music through SoundCloud and Facebook. Other acts take the sound into a wonkier and more synth-heavy direction.

 Briddim is a form of Brostep that emerged in the mid-to-late 2010s. With its name a combination of "brostep" and "riddim", the style incorporates the kick-clap rhythm of Riddim into brostep production, resulting in a distinct off-beat sound. Additionally, the style foregoes riddim's minimal, repetitive and rolling sound, instead sticking to brostep's drop-oriented structures, with distinct intros and buildups, unlike riddim's more traditional progressions. As its roots mostly go back to brostep producers who began to use riddim rhythms, and since it was often called simply riddim (before "briddim" caught on as a term), the sound was often proclaimed as "fake" or inauthentic riddim by riddim fans. Additionally, though the style typically replaces riddim's gritty LFO synth leads with growly brostep sound design, it often has a swampy, "wet" and metallic sound inspired by riddim.

1290:
 Future riddim is a form of Riddim that emerged in the late 2010s. Primarily pioneered by producer Oolacile, future riddim presents a conscious stylistic shift away from the harsh and atonal sounds of Oolacile's and other earlier producers' riddim style, trading LFOs and gritty synths for futuristic, melodic, and vibrant synth leads primarily inspired by Future Bass, and to a lesser extent Melodic Dubstep. 

Like Briddim, future riddim typically features half-time triplets, with prominently side-chained production that highlights the sound design, though it contains a far stronger melodic focus. Oolacile's label Halcyon would become a hub for other producers that helped the growth of the style, featuring up-and-coming producers in compilations like Halcyon Sound Vol. 1 and Enchanted Vol. 1. Many producers would continue to produce more typical riddim alongside future riddim, instead of completely shifting their music in that direction. The rise of future riddim towards the late 2010s would parallel (or follow) the rise of Colour Bass, a similarly melodic and futuristic development of late 2010s Brostep primarily pioneered by Chime and other producers affiliated with his Rushdown label, many of which would also dabble in future riddim alongside colour bass.

Michael Thomas Volpe, known professionally as Clams Casino, is an American record producer and songwriter from Nutley, New Jersey. Volpe is known for his work in production for several cloud rap artists in the early 2010s.

I used to listen to his instrumentals a lot back in highschool, maybe even back into late elementary school. 

On my 15th music daily I posted a mashup of one of his songs with a song by Death Grips, but that was a long while after I had learned about the two. At this point I'm not sure who I started listening to first.

Here are three of his instrumentals. I'm not sure when the official releases for these came out, but the soundcloud releases were generally around 2009-2012

An official release called Instrumental Relics came out in 2020 compiling these with some other tracks. They really hold up. Very nostalgic music for me.

Larakaraka is a traditional courtship dance that originated from the Acholi people of Uganda. This dance, among the more than 50 Acholi dances, holds significant importance and is typically performed on special occasions, particularly weddings. Serving as a romantic display of artistry and physical prowess, Larakaraka enables young men to exhibit their dancing skills, vitality, and agility, all with the intention of attracting a potential life partner.

The dance is characterized by dynamic movements and acrobatics, with dancers often executing jumps and spins in mid-air. Accompanied by traditional Acholi music played on drums, harps, flutes, and other instruments, this vibrant display of talent and culture is a significant part of the Acholi heritage.

Acholitronix was founded in the early 2000s by Otim Alpha and Leo PaLayeng, in an attempt to replace the expensive larakaraka ensembles present at traditional Acholi weddings. The two collaborated to create an electronic-inspired version of the larakaraka dance music, which soon extended to electronic reinterpretations of other folk and ceremonial songs of the Acholi people, with a heavy emphasis on danceable rhythms and traditional motifs and sounds. Many traditional instruments are used, such as the nanga harp, which is considered essential to Acholi Music, as well as traditional lyrics and vocal performances. This is layered over Electronic Dance Music inspired instrumentation, based on traditional Acholi rhythms, typically played between 110 and 170 BPM. The music has since gained mainstream appeal not only in Acholiland, but in Uganda and other East African countries as well, being especially prominent in the club scene of these countries.

Algorave is a genre of dancefloor-oriented music that is typically produced live via algorithms. It is often performed at live dance events—known as algoraves—wherein performers 'livecode' to produce music in front of an audience. Using specialized software, which is often open-source, they generate and adjust their music live using programming language. It is common for performers to project their computer screen while livecoding, allowing the audience to view the alterations of code in real-time. Sonically, algorave is characterised by generative and unpredictable drum and synth patterns. Artists tend to avoid the repeated phrases that commonly characterise other forms of Electronic Dance Music. It is not uncommon for unintended errors to occur in the coding process, meaning that the music can deviate from even the artist's intentions with surprising results.

The genre was first given its name by Alex McLean in 2012. It draws on previously existing movements such as academic 'computer music' and the broader 'livecoding' movement, the latter of which can be traced back to Julian Rohrhuber in 2004. Though the term is primarily applied to recordings of live events, there are nonetheless many artists who use the term to describe work in traditional commercial formats. Since 2012, algorave events have been held with increasing frequency around the world. Labels such as Superpang, CO-DEPENDENT and FLUF were established from 2016-2020 and began to release many recordings of live performances as well as previously unheard music.

Coined by In/Humanity, emoviolence came out of the burgeoning Screamo and Powerviolence scenes, building upon the volatile approach taken by early bands such as Honeywell and Makara. The primary innovators in the emoviolence scene are generally regarded as Orchid, pageninetynine, and Jeromes Dream, who all took an extremely aggressive approach even by the standards of screamo. Songs were shortened to the point that they rarely surpassed three minutes, unconventional methods of screaming were utilized, and blast-beats were often used. These changes marked a profound influence from the Californian powerviolence and Grindcore scenes. Artists like Reversal of Man and Combatwoundedveteran, both from the vibrant Florida screamo scene, bridged the gap between the two genres, foregoing a fusion and instead swapping approaches on releases and tracks.

Erica Abi Wright, known professionally as Erykah Badu, is an American singer and songwriter. Influenced by R&B, soul, and hip hop, Badu rose to prominence in the late 1990s when her debut album Baduizm, placed her at the forefront of the neo soul movement, earning her the nickname "Queen of Neo Soul" by music critics.

I've mentioned her on recs 539, 693, and 888.

Soul jazz is a subgenre of Jazz that appeared during the 1950s, when Gospel, Rhythm & Blues and later Soul started to influence the style of prolific jazz musicians such as Horace Silver, whose composition "The Preacher" quickly became a staple of the genre. The characteristic "groove" of soul jazz became especially popular during the late 1950 and the early 1960s, when Hard Bop was becoming the leading form of jazz. Hence, both genres developed in close association with each other to the extent that a great deal of soul jazz fell within the scope of hard bop.

During the first half of the 1950s, R&B-influenced jazz emerged as an alternative to both Cool Jazz and Bebop. The appearance of soul jazz represented the fusion of different Afro-American musics as a response to the "white" sound of West Coast jazz; all of this during the early days of the Civil Rights Movement. Soul jazz hits in this era include Illinois Jacquet's "Port of Rico" and Jimmy Forrest's "Night Train". When hard bop evolved out of bebop in the mid-1950s, many ensembles fully embraced soul jazz, giving rise to a movement that would last until the late 1960s. Amongst the first to explore the combination of hard bop and soul jazz were a first generation of tenor saxophonists with a swing and bebop background as well as notable r&b influences.  Besides the tenor saxophone, the quintessential soul jazz instrument was the Hammond B-3 electric organ. The first and most crucial organist in the history of soul jazz was Jimmy Smith. His lead was followed by other important figures such as Johnny Hammond, Baby Face Willette, Shirley Scott, Richard "Groove" Holmes and Jack McDuff. The popular organ trio configuration usually included guitarists such as Grant Green, Kenny Burrell and Pat Martino.

There's a lot of great and interesting stuff in the genre, so I'm sure I'll revisit it later. For now, here's the first track on a 1970 album, Red Clay, by Freddie Hubbard

Astigmatic is a 1966 album Post-Bop, Avant-Garde Jazz album by the Komeda Quintet, led by Krzysztof Komeda.
https://youtu.be/tzD1OjHNc6s

Krzysztof Trzciński, known professionally as Krzysztof Komeda, was a Polish film music composer and jazz pianist. Perhaps best known for his work in film scores, Komeda wrote the scores for Roman Polanski’s films Knife in the Water, Cul-de-sac, The Fearless Vampire Killers, and Rosemary’s Baby.

In December 1968, in Los Angeles, Komeda had a tragic accident which led to a haematoma of the brain. He was pushed off an escarpment by writer Marek Hłasko during a drinking party. Film director and convicted sex offender and fugitive from the United States justice system since 1978 Roman Polański mentioned in his memoirs that as a result of friendly rough-and-tumble with Marek Hłasko, Komeda fell down and suffered head injuries. Medical treatment in the US hospital did not save his life. After being transported home to Poland in a coma and in a terminal state, he died in April 1969, aged 37. Hłasko himself died just two months later, aged 35.


Here's an excerpt of a review of the album by Jazzis on RYM:
This music, encapsulated for eternity in a piece of plastic, is one of the great milestones of human Culture, an ultra-rare eruption of human genius. Recorded by a quintet led by Polish pianist / composer Krzysztof Komeda, the legendary Godfather of Polish Jazz, this is definitely the most important piece of music recorded in Eastern Europe, which changed the face of Culture far beyond what most people realize. Universally accepted as a model and artistic / aesthetic climax by generations of Jazz musicians in Komeda's native Poland and far beyond the country borders, this modern Jazz recording influenced innumerable minds and prompted endless artistic processes.

Bass house is a form of House that emerged around the mid-2010s. As its name suggests, it is often broadly described as a fusion of house and bass music styles. The genre usually shares many traits of Electro House (in particular Fidget House and Complextro), similarly featuring punchy drums, tempos around 128 BPM, and more complex, synthetic sound design with prominent, fuzzy basslines and dirty leads. It's usually distinguished by influences from Dubstep and UK Garage subgenres, most commonly wobbles and synth growls resembling Brostep. Tracks often also incorporate sizzling leads similar to Bassline, as well as more intense, shuffling percussion resembling Speed Garage. Future House, which rose to popularity around that time, was occasionally influencing the genre as well. That being said, some strains of bass house are more minimalistic, with stronger elements of Tech House, especially Deep Tech, and G-House. Because of this, Brazilian Bass and Slap House are other closely-related genres sometimes considered bass house as well. Another common element of the genre is the frequent crossover with other bass music genres, with many tracks and mixes incorporating parts of Trap [EDM], dubstep, Breakbeat, and Drum and Bass styles. Additionally, bass house's drum samples and synths are often more similar to the ones found in genres like brostep, Hybrid Trap, or Neurofunk and its offshoots, than other house subgenres.

Christopher Nicholas "Nick" Bertke (born 26 July 1988), better known by his stage name Pogo, which is symbolized by an icon of a rabbit, is a South African-born Australian electronic musician. Much of his work consists of recording small sounds, quotes, and melodies from films, TV programmes or other sources, and sequencing the sounds together to form a new piece of music (a genre also known as plunderphonics). 

I used to listen to him a bit back in elementary school. In the past decade he's been involved in various controversies due to some very assholish homophobic and misogynistic statements he's made online, so I haven't felt a real desire to listen to his music again.

In any case, if I separate the artist from the art, I am able to enjoy his music. His work was pretty major in getting me into electronic music, so for that reason it's nice to revisit.

Ambient americana is a form of Ambient made using instruments typically associated with Americana or Country. It is typically instrumental, featuring acoustic, bass, and steel guitars, harmonica, and sometimes supplemented by dobro, mandolin, drums and/or electronics. The style usually puts emphasis on evoking pastoral desert imagery.

The roots of ambient Americana can be traced back to the 1980s, specifically Brian Eno's Apollo: Atmospheres & Soundtracks providing a template of soothing ambiance alongside tones typically found in Americana and other Northern American Music. The 2000 album The World Turned Gingham from Hank & Slim provided a more modern take on the genre, combining samples and drones with evocative soundscapes.

The style gained more popularity and critical response in the 2010s, with artists like Suss, Barn Owl, Marisa Anderson, and William Tyler exploring and expanding the sound further.

Meditative and spiritual as you can expect from the genre. Sanders was 30 when he played on this album, compared to Promises (rec 1226) which was recorded when he was 80. It's interesting hearing that difference.

Attack No. 1 (アタックNo.1, Atakku Nanbā Wan) is a Japanese manga series by Chikako Urano. It became the first televised female sports anime series in the shōjo category. 

The anime is an adaptation of Urano's 1968 volleyball manga serialized in Weekly Margaret Magazine under the same name. Urano was considered one of the founders of shōjo anime. The series was introduced not only to push the older female manga fan base into the anime mainstream, but also capitalizes on the boom of the gold medal Japanese women's volleyball team in the 1964 Olympics. It The show did stand out in an era dominated by shōnen adventures and sci-fi anime, and was well received in the anime-friendly television markets of France, Italy, and Germany.
https://youtu.be/2Z8YP3B60gM

It has been adapted into 4 anime movies and a 2005 live action drama.

Artcore is an EDM genre pioneered in the Japanese doujin and Bemani rhythm game music scenes of the early 2000s. The genre combines the sound design, drum patterns, BPM, and genre conventions of various electronic dance music genres and the instrumentation and melodic stylings of Western Classical Music, most commonly Cinematic Classical. While Drum and Bass is the most common style used in artcore, the influences of the genre are quite eclectic, utilizing the sounds of Trance and Hardcore [EDM]. Many modern artcore artists also utilize more recent types of electronic music such as Brostep and Electro House. Artcore songs are typically short and instrumental, focusing heavily upon creating a highly emotional, awe-inspiring atmosphere. Although mostly known for being produced from Japan, artcore is also made by many Korean producers and overall has a cult following in underground scenes around the world.

Here's Phant Solo II by Taishi.

Artcore is an inherently varied genre. Here's a track off a 2011 album, Parousia, by xi.

Diamond Jubilee is a 2024 album by Cindy Lee. Cindy Lee is the drag queen hypnagogic pop project of Canadian musician Patrick Flegel, former guitarist and lead singer of Women.
https://youtu.be/_LJi5na897Y

The album is a little hard to categorize because it takes from so many genres, but Hypnagogic Pop, Psychedelic Pop and Indie Rock with Brill Building influence all fit.

It's groovy and intentionally nostalgic with a lo-fi but atmospheric quality. Reminiscent of the Wall of Sound technique pioneered in the 60s.

According to the review aggregator Metacritic, Diamond Jubilee received "universal acclaim" based on a weighted average score of 95 out of 100 from 4 critic scores. Andy Cush of Pitchfork gave the album a 9.1/10 review, calling it "an essential trove of music" where "each song is like a foggy transmission from a rock 'n' roll netherworld with its own ghostly canon of beloved hits". It was the highest rating awarded by the website to a new album since Fiona Apple's 2020 album Fetch the Bolt Cutters.

I don't think the album is a consistently high-quality the whole way through; some of the tracaks drag on on a little or are just a bit boring, but it's worth a listen. There's a lot of creativity throughout the whole 2 hour run time.

Abrupt ending

Tejano 

Tejano music as a distinct style began to emerge around the 1930s and 1940s along the border of Mexico and Texas, developed by the Tejanos, a people and culture which descends from the Hispanic settlers from before Texas was a US state. Tejano music is typically performed in small groups and stylistically is defined by a combination of Mexican Music and Northern American Music influences, originally developing primarily from Norteño and incorporating rhythms from European dances like Polkas and waltzes. By the 1950s and 1960s, the genre was also heavily influenced by the growing styles of Country, Rhythm & Blues, and Rock & Roll. Tejano music saw its peak popularity and commercial success in the 1990s, led by Latin Pop singer and "Queen of Tejano music" Selena, but has maintained regional popularity in the decades since.

Here's Selena's 1995 single Dreaming of You 
https://youtu.be/VRU2qs82DAg

Here's a live performance by Texas Tornados, Who Were You Thinkin' Of, from 1990
https://youtu.be/DhLTLOhU9Yw

Early Tejano groups typically took the form of the conjunto tejano, based on Mexican Folk Music conjunto ensembles, featuring the button accordion, bajo sexto, electric bass, and drum kit. This setup is augmented in the Tejano orquesta with keyboards and a brass section, whereas the 'modern' style ensemble sticks primarily to a guitar/bass/drums/synthesizer setup found in American popular music like Rock. However, even these modern groups will often replace synthesizer with accordion to emphasize their Mexican folk roots.

Cumbia 

Cumbia is a danceable folk music genre formed during the 19th century in Colombia and eastern Panama. Its origins in Native American and African traditions give it a clearly distinctive sound, based on instruments such as keys, percussion, güiro, flutes or accordion.

The percussion is characterized by the usage of three different drums: tamborera, tambor alegre and lamador. The wind instruments also consist of three types of Colombian flutes: gaita macho, gaita hembra and flauta de millo. Güiro and claves are played in 4/4 progression (in recent times, 2/4 became a common way to play). Later other instruments were added such as bongo drums, clarinets, horns and keyboards.

During the twentieth century, with the appearance of labels Discos Fuentes and Sonolux, cumbia became a distinguished ballroom dance that began to be heard little by little throughout all Latin America. The great exponent of the internationalization of cumbia was Lucho Bermúdez, which was seconded by Aniceto Molina, Pedro Salcedo, Los Corraleros de Majagual, among others.


Nueva cumbia chilena is a form of Cumbia chilena that first emerged in the 2000s. Characterized by a modern approach to cumbia, the genre incorporates various instruments and rhythmic components from diverse genres such as Ska, Salsa, Indigenous Andean Music, Reggae, Bolero, and in rare cases even European Folk Music, specifically Balkan Folk Music, Klezmer, or Romani Folk Music

Cumbia chilena

Cumbia chilena is a genre that incorporates elements of popular and/or folkloric Chilean Music into the traditional sound of Cumbia. Cumbia chilena is defined as a melodic, upbeat, and easy to dance style of music where lead instruments made of bronze are accompanied by piano, electric guitar, timpani, double bass and other types of percussion. Unlike the original Cumbia colombiana, the folk elements were almost completely removed and a different rhythm was adopted.

Cumbia chilena's origins date back to the 1960s, when cumbia groups began to emerge in Chile called "combos" or "sonoras".

Nueva cumbia chilena is a form of Cumbia chilena that first emerged in the 2000s. Characterized by a modern approach to cumbia, the genre incorporates various instruments and rhythmic components from diverse genres such as Ska, Salsa, Indigenous Andean Music, Reggae, Bolero, and in rare cases even European Folk Music, specifically Balkan Folk Music, Klezmer, or Romani Folk Music. Many musicians were also further inspired by the political consciousness and aesthetic of the rising Hip Hop scenes in Latin America. The rise of the sound is often contextualized as a part of the rise of the Latin Alternative wave, as well as the rise of many modern cumbia genres from all over Latin America, such as Peru's tecno-cumbia, Digital Cumbia, and the Cumbia villera of Argentina. The sound's rise has also been contrasted by the more conservative and traditional-sounding cumbia wave of nueva movida tropical chilena or cumbia romántica chilena, whose aesthetic and influences are much closer to classic cumbia than the newer trend, which is spearheaded by young independent groups.

Norteño 

Norteño (from a Spanish word for 'northern') is a more traditional, rural version of Tejano Music. The most typical instruments in this genre are accordion, the bajo sexto (a baritone-range twelve-string guitar), classical guitars, bass, drums, one or two expressive vocalists, and, especially in Chihuahua and Zacatecas, saxophones.

Sierreño and Corrido tumbado
 
Sierreño is a style of Norteño music that is mainly played with guitars, as opposed to the traditional bajo sexto used in norteño. It usually has no percussion and the use of accordion is also very uncommon as a melodic instrument as the guitars assume that role. Artists often use twelve-string guitars and the music features prominent guitar work accompanied with bass guitar or tuba. The style was pionereed by Miguel y Miguel in the 1990s with a more traditional Corrido and Ranchera sound but it gained popularity in Mexico with the more melodic aproach of Los Plebes del Rancho de Ariel Camacho's hit "Te metiste" in 2015. 

The popularity of Sierreño genre and "urbano" music (especially Trap) around the mid-2010s among the Mexican and Mexican-American youth resulted in a mexican regional genre with trap influence called corridos tumbados in late 2010s. The influence of trap in the music is very subtle but can be found mainly in its culture, overall hazy and drugged-out atmosphere, and lyrics dealing with boastful, life experiences, and drug consumption themes. The music of corridos tumbados is similar to sierreño but with intrincate acoustic guitar and bass guitar playing, often in minor key and a 3/4 rhythm taking a very mellow and melodic sound. Vocals are delivered like something in between singing and a slow rap-like fashion. Despite its name, songs of the genre are not related to corridos and lack the informative storytelling of those in favor of something more personal.

Bandas de viento de México and Banda sinaloense

Bandas de viento de México describes music performed by brass bands across Mexico. Formed during the 1860s and 1870s by many locals trying to imitate the various military bands that were present in the country, the composition of the interpreting groups change depending on the region. Due to the widespread presence of this type of ensembles, a strong sense of community is built around each band in their places of origin. There has also been the immense popularity for decades of one of its forms, Banda sinaloense. Thus, unlike many other genres, this tradition remains vibrant in many places. 


Banda sinaloense is a form of Mexican brass band music which originated in the western state of Sinaloa. Usually, banda sinaloense is performed with the militaristic-type arrangements of traditional Bandas de viento de México music, with prominence on the tuba / sousaphone backing and tenor tuned horns. Bands from the style often incorporate large amounts of brass & woodwind musicians with the accompanyment of marching-type percussive instruments, usually within a range of 15-20 members; some bands may also include distinct instruments including the clarinet and accordion.

Movimiento alterado 

Movimiento alterado is a brand of Mexican Music that arose from Sinaloa in the late 2000s, radicalizing some of the characteristics of Banda sinaloense and Norteño. The lyrics graphically depict scenes of violence in rural Mexico, and the aesthetics of movimiento alterado groups are closely related to drug cartels.

Cumbia norteña

Cumbia norteña is a style of Norteño music heavily influenced by Cumbia. Its origin dates back to the 1960's when cumbia's popularity in Mexico was solidified and it combined with the music of the north Mexican states of Nuevo León and Tamaulipas as well as Texas in the United States. The genre is dance oriented and lyrics are often fun and care-free. Bands of the genre retain the instrumentation and aesthetics of a norteño band. The melodies and motifs resemble those of cumbia, sometimes having the distinctive cumbia rhythm though it may also be a fast paced 2/4 rhythm. Popular groups include Tigrillos and Control.

Nortec

The name of the genre is a portmanteau of Norteño and Techno but in itself, Nortec is electronic music created by a collection of artists mostly from the US-Mexico border town Tijuana, sampling and synthesizing sounds/beats from traditional Banda sinaloense and Norteño into a unique translation of Hispanic American Music/Modern Mexican Music music into an IDM/House-type form.

Ranchera 

Ranchera or canción ranchera ("ranch song”) is a popular genre of Mexican Music developed in the nationalist theater of the post-1910 revolution period in Mexico. From the 1930s onward, rancheras became an important part of Mexican films, several of which- such as Allá en el Rancho Grande [Over at the Big Ranch]- were built around well-known songs. In the 1930s, the Mexican government actively promoted ranchera, fostering the production of musical films known as comedias rancheras, featuring acclaimed radio personalities such as Jorge Negrete, Pedro Infante and José Alfredo Jiménez.

https://youtu.be/ssqQH4K2hNw

If rancheras were ever genuinely folk music, they soon became commercial songs performed mostly by urban singers. Professional singers developed an extremely emotional style, one of whose characteristics is a held note at the end of a line, culminating in a "dying fall" that could drop a third or more. Like Corridos, rancheras can be accompanied by different types of instrumental groups, such as bandas sinaloenses, conjuntos Norteños, Mariachis, marimba groups, and orquestas típicas.

Corrido

Born in the late 18th century, corridos flourished after the Mexican Independence War, with "the golden period" culminating with the Mexican Revolution one century later. Corridos were meant to spread news through the Mexican territory by folk singers who usually just accompanied the song with a guitar. Lyrically corridos follow a simple structure where they introduce themselves, proceed to tell a story, and telling the moral of the story at the end. Time signatures are mostly 3/4 with the verses consisting of 8 syllables.

Recently the theme of corridos has been focused towards drug kingpins creating the so-called "narco-corridos", being closer to the Norteño genre while retaining some forms of the classical corridos. 

Here's a performance by Chalino Sánchez of Alma Enamorada from his 1992 album Ya Después De Muerto.
https://youtu.be/dMNBjH--74w

Famously, at this performance and seen in the video, Chalino was handed a note from someone in the crowd. The note is commonly believed to have been a death threat whereby he would be killed after the song, but this has never been confirmed. A video recording of the song "Alma Enamorada" shows Chalino crumpling up the note—in a clear state of shock—before singing the song as if nothing happened. After midnight, Chalino drove away from the club with two of his brothers, a cousin, and several young women. They were pulled over by a group of armed men in black Chevrolet Suburbans. They showed state police ID cards and told Chalino their commander wanted to see him. Chalino agreed and got into one of their cars while the others stayed behind.

The following day, at six in the morning, two farmers found Chalino's body by an irrigation canal near Highway 15, near the neighborhood of Los Laureles, Culiacán. He was blindfolded and his wrists were red and had rope marks. He had been shot in the back of the head twice.

Also famously: In 1975 his sister was raped, and two years later in 1977 Chalino saw the man at a party and allegedly shot him in revenge, killing him. Chalino was 15 at this time. After committing this act, Sanchez left for Tijuana with his gun and a Jesús Malverde chain. During his time in Tijuana, he worked as a "coyote" (an immigrant smuggler), taking immigrants into the United States.

Sierreño 

Going back to what I referenced on 1324, Sierreño was pionereed by Miguel y Miguel in the 1990s with a more traditional Corrido and Ranchera sound.

Here's Miguel y Miguel's single Los Años Que Yo Tengo from 2001.

Moving on from that short series on some popular Mexican genres

1331:
Death industrial is a development of Noise and Industrial music characterized by the creation of densely dark atmospheres with noise-infused textures and production techniques rooted in Power Electronics. The genre emerged from the late 1980s power electronics scene through pioneering experiments by acts Ramleh, Genocide Organ and Mz.412, whose production styles incorporated elements of Dark Ambient by exchanging the abrasive attributes of power electronics for more atmosphere-orientated production; this effect is achieved with low pitched Drones and distorted synth loops, as well as a subdued pace. As in power electronics, vocals are sometimes used in form of harsh, shouted or spoken performances rather than sung.

Here's Caligula, a 2019 album by Lingua Ignota.
https://youtu.be/VkJC-LvXrv0

Hateful, misanthropic, and dark, but very cinematic. The 4th track is the first on the album to lean hard into noise.

1332:
Tearout is a form of Dubstep that developed in the late 2000s. It is characterized by a gritty, aggressive, and dancefloor-focused sound, emphasizing punchy and dominant midrange, "wobbly" sound design, contrasting with the atmospheric and deep sound of earlier dubstep. Tearout generally features greater dynamic differences throughout the track as well, often with pronounced drops and buildups, that somewhat contrast with earlier, repetitive styles. That being said, some tearout is equally repetitive, and earlier dubstep sometimes featured drop-buildup structures as well. First pioneered by artists in the mid-2000s UK dubstep scene, such as Rusko and Caspa, tearout would quickly rise to become one of the most influential and controversial styles in the dubstep scene. As the 2000s came to a close, tearout producers began developing a new sound that maintained the aggression of tearout but featured increased variation in the drops, and lacked the rolling, deep basslines of tearout. The new sound further emphasized low, growling synths and/or high-pitched leads, and it would come to be known as Brostep.

Here's a track from Culprate's 2011 album Flatline. I mentioned Culprate before all the way back on day 308.

1333:
Tearout is also a subgenre of Brostep that is notable for its exaggeratedly heavy and blown out sound. Primarily emerging from Deathstep, tearout shares elements such as percussive "machine gun" FM basslines, heavy drums, "screechy" sound design, and distorted sub-basses. Tearout often uses clipping above 0dB as an integral part of its sound design, giving it a distorted, "blown out" sound. Tearout is differentiated from deathstep by its chaotic feel and more consistent, and denser flow, drawn from brostep.

Tearout derives its name from the earlier Dubstep subgenre also known as Tearout, described on the previous rec, though the two have little musical or cultural relation. Tearout emerged in the early-2010s but was popularized in the mid-2010s with artists such as MARAUDA, SVDDEN DEATH, and PhaseOne, finding early prominence on major brostep labels such as Never Say Die, Black Label, and Marauda's Malignant Music. With time, the genre developed a heavy overlap with Briddim, adopting its repetitive basslines and off-kilter feel. The genre is still prominently featured on labels such as Disciple Recordings and has been adopted by major brostep producers such as MUST DIE! and Excision.

I recently played through Bramble: The Mountain King, a short game with simmilarities to Limbo and Little Nightmares. It has a great soundtrack, including what's now one of my favorite renditions of Edvard Grieg's 1875 orchestral work "In the Hall of the Mountain King." It's a slow buildup that approaches its climax as you approach the mountain king and progress his boss fight

Rage is a subgenre of Trap developed in the early 2020s. It is characterized by dense, buzzing synth work inspired by 2010s Electronic Dance Music, mainly Future Bass, with repetitive chord progressions and melodic, often euphoric synth leads, typically performed in an energetic rap style. The genre also takes cues from the production style of Pi'erre Bourne, whose work with rapper Playboi Carti laid out the foundation for rage's unorthodox and repetitive song structure. This departure from a conventional Hip Hop song structure contributed to rage's distinct "punk ethos."

The genre would solidify itself with the collaboration between Playboi Carti and Working on Dying's F1LTHY on the dissonant Whole Lotta Red. However, it was Trippie Redd's "Miss the Rage" snippet that gained major popularity around the Internet, notably composed by reversing a future bass loop from a Cymatics sample pack. This would lead to the naming of the genre, commonly searched on YouTube as "Rage Beats" or "Rage Type Beat." Rage has been heavily influenced by the SoundCloud scene, specifically artists from subgenres like Plugg/PluggnB, Digicore, and Cloud Rap. Rage has proven to be influential in the trap scene, heavily inspiring the sound of New Jazz. 

Here's a Rage and HexD track from a month ago by ODETARI 
https://youtu.be/vi72_ggUCHU (2024)
Its a bit unusual for new HexD and Rage music to get this many listens in such a short time. 

As a reminder, HexD is a genre using heavily bit-crushed vocals, sometimes sped-up and pitched-up, and highly compressed and distorted production, typically made from existing material of other genres.

 New jazz is a style of Trap that developed from the SoundCloud underground community in the early 2020s. The style was pioneered by producer Amir and later coined by rapper/producer Lunchbox, who first popularized the genre outside of its immediate SoundCloud niche.

New jazz is characterized by its colorful and repetitive synth work, a feature derived from syncopated, less-abrasive Rage music. The use of synthetic saxophone and trumpet presets is also common as well as analog snare fills and instruments like e-pianos and synthetic organs. New jazz instrumentals often emphasize a tresillo-esque bounce, most clearly heard in its syncopated lead melodies, and at times, its hi-hat drum programming. Typical new jazz production incorporates a diverse array of bass instruments, referencing dizzying CTM 808s and wonky analog bass as often as every measure. Certain new jazz also incorporates cute and playful vocal loops, often sourced from popular songs and online loop packs.

Producers like фрози [frozy], Tenseoh, and venny would go on to popularize the genre on short-video platforms like TikTok, releasing catchy new jazz instrumentals as shorts and on digital streaming platforms. Upon going viral, new jazz would both influence and be influenced by a number of genres, namely House, Jersey Club Rap, and PluggnB.

Wave emerged in the mid-2010s as a dark, melancholic style of electronic music, blending Cloud Rap’s dreamy atmospheres with more intense, sinister beats. It incorporates rhythms from Trap, Dubstep, Grime, and UK Bass, often featuring heavy sub-bass, footwork-style drum programming, and distorted synth leads. The genre is mostly instrumental, with dense sci-fi soundscapes and heavily processed vocal samples.

Wave gained popularity through online platforms like SoundCloud and YouTube, spreading from London to the US and Canada. Collectives and independent labels played a key role in its growth, fostering the genre’s underground appeal and futuristic aesthetics.

Roy Anthony Hargrove (October 16, 1969 – November 2, 2018) was an American jazz musician and composer whose principal instruments were the trumpet and flugelhorn. He achieved worldwide acclaim after winning two Grammy Awards for differing styles of jazz in 1998 and 2002. Hargrove primarily played in the hard bop style for the majority of his albums, but also had a penchant for genre-crossing exploration and collaboration with a variety of hip hop, soul, R&B and alternative rock artists. As Hargrove told one reporter, "I've been around all kinds of musicians, and if a cat can play, a cat can play. If it's gospel, funk, R&B, jazz or hip-hop, if it's something that gets in your ear and it's good, that's what matters."

Here's are two differing performances of his song, Strasbourg St. Denis

Geek rock is a subgenre of Alternative Rock which embodies a nerdy aesthetic musically and lyrically. The genre typically features strong Pop Rock melodies and hooks, often drawing directly from Power Pop with its punchy sound and distorted guitars; however, unlike most forms of alternative rock, synthesizers and drum machines are fairly common due to its heavy influence from New Wave. These, and other electronics, may be used alongside other unconventional Rock instrumentation like piano, brass, woodwinds, accordion, melodica, or toy instruments to create a quirky or kitschy atmosphere to match its kitchen-sink approach to songwriting and arrangements. Geek rock is typically lyrically dense and focuses on less conventional topics—pop culture, history, science fiction, fantasy, mythology—but may also approach Pop mainstays like love and relationships with a nerdy twist. Much geek rock is humourous but typically falls short of being Comedy Rock due to its focus on irony, wordplay, and oddball subject matter for its humour, but more overtly comedic crossovers exist particularly in the realm of Musical Parody.

The geek rock genre was pioneered in the late 1980s and early 1990s by They Might Be Giants, whose upbeat and quirky songs built on the more intellectual bent of 1980s college-radio rock and the twitchy, synthesizer-laden sound of bands like Devo. Their 1990 major label debut Flood has been noted as a watershed moment in geek rock. This geekier side of alternative rock was embraced in the mid-to-late 1990s by bands like Self, Fountains of Wayne, Barenaked Ladies, and Weezer-offshoot The Rentals. Nerf Herder were likely the first group to self identify with the "geek rock" term.

The rising popularity of the internet in the new millennium had a massive impact on geek rock, democratising the production and distribution of music. Newer geek rock groups took on more of an Indie Pop-inspired DIY bent, combining lo-fi bedroom instrument recordings with consumer-grade keyboards and lyrics that frequently referenced video games and internet culture along with the genre's typical esoterica. Artists like Logan Whitehurst & The Junior Science Club, Lemon Demon, and Tally Hall found success using Flash animations and early viral videos on YouTube, and Jonathan Coulton became well-known for his songs composed for the Portal video game series, most notably "Still Alive". Other innovations in the 2000s included the incorporation of Chiptune by bands like I Fight Dragons and the emergence of fandom-based scenes like "wizard rock", a movement of Harry Potter-themed Indie Rock that was spearheaded by Harry and the Potters. The geek rock scene was renewed in the late 2010s with the emergence of Needlejuice Records, a label focused around remastered reissues of classic geek rock albums as well as releasing music from newer artists.

1372:
Anti-folk is a style of Contemporary Folk music that originated in New York City during the 1980s as a reaction against what was viewed as an entrenched, elitist folk scene. While vague and wide-encompassing, anti-folk artists are linked by their rawer, more humorous approach to songwriting when compared to other folk subgenres. Anti-folk songs are often delivered in a self-mocking and sarcastic, often deadpan tone, with little to no connection to traditional music, unlike most styles of contemporary folk. Instead, anti-folk is influenced by an eclectic array of musical styles, most notably Punk Rock, often being considered a close relative of Folk Punk.

The origins of anti-folk are vague, with some citing Darryl Cherney as the genre’s creator, while others cite Lach as the founder of the scene, being the founder of a East Village club named The Fort, which served as the epicenter of the anti-folk scene. Other pioneering anti-folk acts include Roger Manning, King Missile, and Billy Syndrome. While the initial Fort club did not last long in its original location, being an illegal club, it relocated throughout the East Village, eventually settling at the Sidewalk Cafe, which served as a regular early venue for widely recognized anti-folk acts such as The Moldy Peaches, Jeffrey Lewis, and Regina Spektor.

1973:
Folk Rock started developing as a genre during the 1960s, and can be considered as a derivation of the Contemporary Folk expressions in the United States.

The style was arguably pioneered by releases such as The Beau Brummels' "Laugh, Laugh" and Bob Dylan's "Mixed Up Confusion" singles. However, two events have commonly been described as catalysts for the development of the Folk Rock movement: the success of the Folk-inflicted, chiming sound of The Byrds and the decision by Dylan (considered a key figure of the American Contemporary Folk movement during the early 1960s) to include electric instrumentation and a backing band in most of his recordings and performances during the mid-60s.

Folk Rock also shared close ties with Folk Pop; artists such as Simon & Garfunkel and Donovan have been considered part of both styles. The genre would also serve as precursor to similarly-minded movements that had their basis in both Rock (such as Country Rock, Roots Rock and Folk Punk) and Folk (exemplified by Psychedelic Folk). Folk Rock has also produced regional variations like Anatolian Rock, Celtic Rock and Nordic Folk Rock.

Blues Rock is Rock that relies on the chords/scales and instrumental improvisation of Blues. The genre started in the 1960s. Artists like Yardbirds, Cream, and John Mayall's Bluesbreakers in the UK and The Allman Brothers Band, Canned Heat, and Johnny Winter in the US eventually brought the sound widespread popularity.

Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota, also known simply as Patricio Rey, Los Redondos or Los Redonditos de Ricota, was a rock band formed in La Plata, Argentina. The group was active from the mid 70s up to the early 2000s.

Rock urbano español, locally known simply as "rock urbano", is a scene originating in Spain from the mid to late 1970s when the Spanish language gained dominance in the local rock scene and, moreso, the end of the Francoist dictatorship which now allowed previously censored social issues including protest, marginal living and taboo lyrics being covered.

Back in the 1960s, there was a general disagreement among Spanish rock acts with the language of performance, which commonly alternated between English and Spanish lyrics. Most of the underground Spanish rock bands from the early 1970s performed mainly in English (aside from some notable regional scenes that opted for other Iberian languages such as Catalan, Basque or Galician). This fact led to most of the Psychedelic Rock bands and some of the earliest Hard Rock references of the country to remain as English-language acts. Some of the Spanish-language hard rock pioneers failed in gaining popularity while others would gradually switch from English to Spanish throughout the decade.

The earliest rock urbano acts were formed at the eve of the end of the country dictatorship (and during the transition to democracy) being mostly Progressive Rock and/or hard rock efforts such as Asfalto, Ñu, Topo, Coz or Leño. Along with other scenes that preferred using Spanish as happened with Rock andaluz, they all were referred as "El rollo"; specially the releases published by Chapa Discos at late 1970s (that were really common to rock urbano).

Extremoduro was a Spanish hard rock band from Plasencia, Extremadura. They were active from 1987 to 2019. The band was led by Roberto Iniesta, also known as "Robe", who is often referred as "El rey de Extremadura" (lit. 'the king of Extremadura').

British blues is a musical movement that formed around the London blues clubs of the 1960s. Its progenitors included Alexis Korner, Tony McPhee and Blues Incorporated who played music heavily influenced by the burgeoning United States Blues scene, particularly the Chicago Blues of the likes of Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf and the Electric Blues of B.B. King.

Korner's protégés included Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac fame and John Mayall who in turn fostered the talents of Eric Clapton, Mick Taylor and Jimmy Page who were to develop the sound into Blues Rock. The scene was also, together with US Rhythm & Blues and Rock & Roll, a major influence on the British Rhythm & Blues sound including The Rolling Stones and The Animals.

True British Blues is closest in form to Chicago blues - where the bands used electric guitars whilst attempting to retain the pure blues form.

Electric Texas blues is a genre of Blues that, although named after the geographic location of its origin, is not bound to that region. It has its roots in Acoustic Texas Blues, from which it developed since the invention of the electric guitar. Notable electric Texas blues artists are T-Bone Walker and Freddie King.

Some characteristics that distinguish it from other genres are the notable Jazz influences such as swing rhythms, extensive single-string guitar soloing, and often the addition of a horn section to the group. 

Here's a 1971 track from Freddie King's 1971 album Getting Ready... 
https://youtu.be/X1UuZbixn5E

Freddie King was an American blues guitarist, singer and songwriter. He is considered one of the "Three Kings of the Blues Guitar" (along with Albert King and B.B. King, none of whom were blood related). Mostly known for his soulful and powerful voice and distinctive guitar playing, King had a major influence on electric blues music and on many later blues guitarists.

Jean Sibelius (8 December 1865 – 20 September 1957) was a Finnish composer of the late Romantic and early modern periods. He is widely regarded as his country's greatest composer, and his music is often credited with having helped Finland develop a stronger national identity when the country was struggling from several attempts at Russification in the late 19th century.

The core of his oeuvre is his set of seven symphonies, which, like his other major works, are regularly performed and recorded in Finland and countries around the world. His other best-known compositions are Finlandia, the Karelia Suite, Valse triste, the Violin Concerto, the choral symphony Kullervo, and The Swan of Tuonela (from the Lemminkäinen Suite). His other works include pieces inspired by nature, Nordic mythology, and the Finnish national epic, the Kalevala; over a hundred songs for voice and piano; incidental music for numerous plays; the one-act opera The Maiden in the Tower; chamber music, piano music, Masonic ritual music, and 21 publications of choral music. 

The Finnish 100 mark note featured his image until 2002, when the euro was adopted. Since 2011, Finland has celebrated a flag flying day on 8 December, the composer's birthday, also known as the Day of Finnish Music. In 2015, in celebration of the 150th anniversary of Sibelius's birth, a number of special concerts and events were held, especially in Helsinki, the Finnish capital.

Here's one composition, Finlandia, Op. 26, composed 1899.

Shona Mbira Music is a typical style from Zimbabwe. It takes its name from Shona people, and from the main instrument: the mbira. A piece of Shona Mbira Music is based on a simple melodic pattern, from which long instrumental parts are improvised. It can be considered as the main root and influence of Chimurenga music.

Ephat Mujuru or Stella Chiweshe are part of the most well-known artists who released albums of Shona Mbira Music. 

Here's a song from Stella Chiweshe's 2002 album Talking Mbira

Chimurenga is Afro-pop music from Zimbabwe popularized by Thomas Mapfumo. It is based on the traditional mbira thumb piano but with modern electric instrumentation and the lyrics are of social and political nature. 

Thomas Tafirenyika Mapfumo is a Zimbabwean musician. He is nicknamed "The Lion of Zimbabwe" and "Mukanya" for his immense popularity and for the political influence he wields through his music, including his sharp criticism of the government of former Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe.

The Bhundu Boys were a Zimbabwean band that played a mixture of chimurenga music with American rock and roll, disco, country, and pop influences. Their style became known as jit, and is quite popular across Africa, with some international success, and has influenced later groups like Nehoreka and Mokoomba.

Jit is guitar-driven electric pop music from Zimbabwe that draws influence from Central and East African rumba, South African jive and local music.

The culture of Italy is as rich and varied as its history, leading to a large mosaic of regional Traditional Folk Music encompassing, for example, Canzone napoletana in the region of Naples, and polyphonic Cantu a tenore in the island of Sardinia. 

I spoke about Canzone napoletana on rec 1011.

Cantu a tenore is a style of secular Polyphonic Chant from the Mediterranean island of Sardinia. It is rural-based music that is often accompanied by a traditional dance. A tenore chorus generally consists of four voices: boche (the lead), mesu boche (half voice), cronta (baritone), and bassu (bass). The lead sings a lyrical text, while the chorus follows with nonsense syllables in a distinctive low register, guttural style.

To talk a bit more on the 2nd track here from 1387, Libera me:
*Deliver me, O Lord, from death eternal on that fearful day,
When the heavens and the earth shall be moved,
When thou shalt come to judge the world by fire.

I am made to tremble, and I fear, till the judgment be upon us, and the coming wrath,
When the heavens and the earth shall be moved.

That day, day of wrath, calamity and misery, day of great and exceeding bitterness,
When thou shalt come to judge the world by fire.

Rest eternal grant unto them, O Lord: and let light perpetual shine upon them.*


"Libera me" ("Deliver me") is a responsory sung in the Office of the Dead ([a prayer cycle of the Canonical Hours in the Catholic, Anglican and Lutheran Churches, said for the repose of the soul of a decedent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_the_Dead)) in the Catholic Church, and at the absolution of the dead, a service of prayers for the dead said beside the coffin immediately after the Requiem Mass and before burial. The text asks God to have mercy upon the deceased person at the Last Judgment.

In addition to the Gregorian chant in the Roman Gradual, many composers have written settings for the text, including Tomás Luis de Victoria, Anton Bruckner, Giuseppe Verdi, Gabriel Fauré, Maurice Duruflé, Igor Stravinsky, Benjamin Britten, Sigismund von Neukomm, Orlande de Lassus, Krzysztof Penderecki, Antonio Salieri, Lorenzo Perosi, Arnold Rosner and Patrick Gowers. 

Here's a performance of Gabriel Fauré's setting for Libera Me (~1887)

Here's a performance of Maurice Duruflé's from 1947, another popular version, but my least favorite among these three

A couple tracks from 核P-model's 2018 album 回=回 (Kai=Kai) 
https://youtu.be/VBuGem170Ew
https://youtu.be/pePeYNHxuvA

I've probably mentioned it before, but P-Model a Japanese electronic rock band started in 1979 by members of the defunct progressive rock band Mandrake. The band has experienced many lineup revisions over the years but frontman Susumu Hirasawa was always at the helm of operations. P-Model officially disbanded in 2000, although many of its members continue to release solo albums and collaborate with each other on different projects.

Hirasawa has since released work under the name "Kaku P-Model", effectively a solo revival of the band. 


回=回 is full of bittersweet throwbacks to prior work, including his work not within 核P-model.  Almost an amalgamation of his entire 40+ year career, loaded up with electronic guitar.

Hirasawa's work has never let me down and this album was no exception.

Girolamo Alessandro Frescobaldi (1583 – 1643) was an Italian composer and virtuoso keyboard player. Born in the Duchy of Ferrara, he was one of the most important composers of keyboard music in the late Renaissance and early Baroque periods. A child prodigy, Frescobaldi studied under Luzzasco Luzzaschi in Ferrara, but was influenced by many composers, including Ascanio Mayone, Giovanni Maria Trabaci, and Claudio Merulo. Girolamo Frescobaldi was appointed organist of St. Peter's Basilica, a focal point of power for the Cappella Giulia (a musical organisation), from 21 July 1608 until 1628 and again from 1634 until his death.

Here's Volume 1 of a compilation of his keyboard works, performed on harpsichord and organ.

Country Rock

Country rock is a combination of contemporary Rock music with a more traditional American style of Country. The basic foundation of country rock is acoustic rhythm guitars with electric lead guitar work, pedal steel guitar, harmonica, snare-active drumming, Close Harmony vocals, falsetto notes and distinctive country rhythms.

The genre originated in the mid-1960s to the early 1970s spearheaded by Gram Parsons, Buffalo Springfield, The Byrds, and Eagles partly as a reaction to the Nashville Sound, which had been perceived as dated, slick, and out of fashion with the young audience. Country rock is closely tied to and heavily influenced by Folk Rock, Roots Rock, and Blues Rock, genres which many popular country rock musicians had played some combination of, including Bob Dylan, The Band, and Neil Young.

During the early to mid 1980s, artists from the Punk Rock scene such as Meat Puppets, Violent Femmes, and Jason & The Scorchers incorporated elements of country rock into their music to form Cowpunk. Around this same time, the blend of Punk-based music with the pastoral sounds of country would eventually develop into the Alternative Rock / Indie Rock influenced Alt-Country, led by Uncle Tupelo, Magnolia Electric Co. and The Jayhawks. 

John Weldon "J. J." Cale was an American guitarist, singer, and songwriter. Though he avoided the limelight, his influence as a musical artist has been acknowledged by figures such as Neil Young, Mark Knopfler, Waylon Jennings, and Eric Clapton, who described him as one of the most important artists in rock history.

Roots rock

Roots rock is Rock music that consciously and predominantly incorporates elements of its musical predecessors and original (especially American) roots such as Country, Blues, Rhythm & Blues, Rock & Roll and American Folk Music, but also may include other American traditions such as the latin-tinged Tex-Mex or Cajun Music. It is closely related to other roots-influenced genres such as Country Rock, Southern Rock and the blues-laden Swamp Rock. As an approach blending different traditionally American music idioms with rock music, roots rock also has large overlaps with genres like Alt-Country and Americana.

Although the term itself grew out of a back-to-basics approach to solid rock in the mid-1980s, it is currently used to encompass much earlier bands and movements with similar aims. The most prominent acts of the first phase in the late 1960s were the Creedence Clearwater Revival and The Band, taking cues from Bob Dylan and even influencing British acts like the Rolling Stones on their late 1960s albums. Alongside southern rock and the less traditionalist Heartland Rock, roots rock continued to be influential in the 1970s with Link Wray, Little Feat and Ry Cooder as prominent acts. It faded from public interest somewhat in the late 1970s. The sound of the phase that established the term in the 1980s can be seen as a grittier, more conservative counterweight to the sonically more radical Heavy Metal or the more modernly electronic New Wave. Among the main artists were John Hiatt and Los Lobos.

Heartland rock is a form of Rock music that rose to prominence in the United States during the mid-1970s.

Bruce Springsteen is often seen as the main progenitor of the style. On his first several studio recordings, Springsteen took influence from the Folk Rock sounds of Bob Dylan, the Rhythm & Blues stylings of Sam Cooke, and the aesthetics of 1950s-60s Rock & Roll artists such as Chuck Berry. During the recording sessions of his third album, Born to Run, Springsteen took massive inspiration from the dense Brill Building sounds established by Phil Spector's Wall of Sound, defining the grandiose and bombastic sounds often associated with the genre. Other musical styles, such as Roots Rock and Garage Rock, were also fundamental to the genre's development. Altogether, heartland rock was characterized by simplistic, straightforward melodic arrangements, soaring guitar textures, lush production, and layered percussion. Some acts incorporated horns and keyboards into their instrumental palettes; as the years progressed, synthesizers became much more commonly used.

Heartland rock often emphasizes social or communal lyrical themes, including economic hardship, drugs, and crime. This gave the genre a much wider working-class appeal compared to other rock styles at the time. This marked especially true in the Rust Belt and Midwestern regions of the United States, as most heartland rock acts originated from those areas, and in turn, helped coin the genre's name.

Although heartland rock did not crystallize as a distinct genre among music journalists until the 1980s, the style achieved enormous popularity during the late 1970s.

The Waterboys - This Is The Sea, This Is The Sea (1985)

Lyrics:

These things you keep
You'd better throw them away
You wanna turn your back
On your soulless days
Once you were tethered
And now you are free
Once you were tethered
Well now you are free
That was the river
This is the sea!

Now if you're feelin' weary
If you've been alone too long...

Big Music

The big music is a commercial style of Rock that emerged in the early 1980s, primarily in the UK. Borne of Post-Punk roots, the style features anthemic Pop Rock songwriting and a production style that uses pounding drums, soaring vocals, and ringing, reverb-heavy lead guitar work to create an "epic", arena-ready sound. Beyond the standard rock band setup, big music artists have also incorporated strings and brass in order to sound even larger. Common influences include contemporaneous New Wave guitar groups, Bruce Springsteen's grandiose Heartland Rock, and the acoustic instrumentation and traditional influences of Celtic Rock.

The term "big music" was coined by Mike Scott of The Waterboys to describe his band's sound, codified by their 1984 single "The Big Music". The term was then picked up by critics to describe other popular rock bands of the period with a large, anthemic sound. Many of these groups – U2, Simple Minds, Big Country – featured production from Steve Lillywhite, who innovated the gated reverb technique that was essential for imitating the arena environment in the studio. The big music was most prominent and commercially successful between 1983 and 1987, fading with the growing prominence of harder-edged Alternative Rock (which some big music artists, notably U2, moved on to). Despite remaining strongly associated with the 1980s, the sound of the big music has influenced more recent Indie Rock artists like Arcade Fire as they moved towards a grander, more mainstream-oriented style.

Rockabilly 

Rockabilly started in the mid-50s at the dawn of Rock & Roll with the influential recordings Elvis Presley made for Sun Records. Originally it was Country musicians playing their own version of uptempo Rhythm & Blues music, resulting in this new style. It usually features driving guitars, frantic vocals and slap-back echo in the bass. Rockabilly still has a big following with new artists emerging every year.

Work Song

Work songs are songs and chants that are sung by laborers and prisoners while working in factories and fields. Work songs typically have a steady rhythm in order to accompany repetitive tasks and often feature improvised homemade instruments. 

A few tracks by Huddie William Ledbetter (~1888 - 1949), better known by the stage name Lead Belly.

https://youtu.be/zIC2hVvKzVQ

Lead Belly was an American folk and blues singer notable for his strong vocals, virtuosity on the twelve-string guitar, and the folk standards he introduced.

Electric Blues
 
The Blues underwent significant development when instruments like the electric guitar were amplified, especially after World War II in Chicago. This shift to amplified electric blues greatly influenced Rock & Roll and later genres like Blues Rock, Hard Rock, and Heavy Metal. The genre saw revivals, particularly in the 2000s with the Garage Rock Revival.

Amplification changed the dynamics of blues, allowing guitars, bass, and harmonicas to gain prominence over louder instruments like the piano, which had dominated clubs in the 1920s and 1940s. This led to the establishment of the guitar as the central instrument in blues, setting the stage for the "guitar hero" archetype in rock music.

By the late 1940s, electric blues became economically viable, with hits among urban audiences, such as T-Bone Walker's "Call It Stormy Monday." Walker's sophisticated guitar work distinguished Electric Texas Blues from the Chicago blues style. Muddy Waters' hit "I Can’t Be Satisfied" marked a key moment in the evolution of electric blues, maintaining the essence of traditional Country Blues while introducing amplified elements. This developed into Chicago Blues, the genre's enduring branch, with Chess Records playing a pivotal role in promoting many electric blues artists in the 1950s and 1960s.

Chicago Blues

Emerging in the 1940s, Chicago blues became the most influential form of Electric Blues, shaping contemporary Blues music, Blues Rock, and Rock overall. Sometimes referred to as electric Chicago blues, it differentiates from Acoustic Chicago Blues. This genre is rooted in rural Delta Blues, adapted for small bands with amplified guitars, harmonicas, bass, and drums, often incorporating saxophones and horn sections.

Unlike other electric blues forms, Chicago blues maintained a raw and gritty sound, characterized by expressive vocals, slide guitar, high volume, and distortion. It commonly employs a twelve-bar blues structure, serving as a blueprint for Rock & Roll and the British Blues movement.

After Black workers migrated from the Mississippi region to the north, various blues scenes emerged, with Chicago blues being the most influential. Muddy Waters' hit "I Can't Be Satisfied" marked the genre's breakthrough, showcasing an amplified version of Country Blues. Chicago blues introduced many renowned guitarists like Elmore James and Buddy Guy.

While accommodating vocalists and pianists, the electric guitar and amplified harmonica have been its primary instruments. The harmonica played a crucial role initially, leading to the distinction in credits on recordings. Although the guitar has since dominated, the harmonica remains integral to Chicago blues, represented by artists like Sonny Boy Williamson II and Junior Wells.

Hill Country Blues

Hill country blues, originating from the hilly region of North Mississippi, emphasizes a steady, hypnotic groove with sparse, energetic guitar riffs and unconventional song structures that feature fewer chord changes compared to Delta Blues.

The genre is characterized by driving rhythms and is rooted in the blues traditions of the region. Key figures from the greater Holly Springs area helped define this style, which is often played as both acoustic and electric dance music. Hill country blues maintains a rough, unrefined edge and remained largely unrecorded for decades as it developed following the migration of blues musicians to larger cities.

While some recordings emerged in the 1970s, it was in the early 1990s that the genre gained greater popularity and preservation through specific record labels, showcasing artists well into their careers. This contributed to a renewed interest in hill country blues, with compilations documenting its history and evolution.

The genre’s gritty sound gained further exposure through collaborations that introduced new elements, impacting the Alternative Rock and Garage Rock scenes. Many contemporary bands draw from hill country blues, continuing its influence in the broader landscape of blues music.

Delta Blues

Delta Blues is named after the Mississippi Delta region of the USA where the genre developed. It is regarded as one of the earliest styles of Blues music and displays many of the hallmarks of traditional blues – the call-response lyrical format and the 12-bar structure for example.

The primary instruments of delta blues are the acoustic guitar and the harmonica with many artists also employing slide guitar techniques (often on the steel guitar); the ‘Dobro’ or national resonator guitar was also popular. The structure is highly rhythmic and the vocals are clear and strong with repeated lines a trademark. The subject matter is often personal and covers the hard life experienced by the southern African-American farming communities that populated the delta in the late 19th century and first half of the 20th century.

Charley Patton, Son House and Robert Johnson are perhaps the best known of the original delta bluesmen with Ishman Bracey, Mississippi John Hurt, Tommy Johnson and Skip James also highly regarded. Later on the likes of Muddy Waters and John Lee Hooker started making delta blues before becoming better known for their work in Chicago & Detroit.

Piedmont Blues 

Piedmont blues is a Country Blues style that originated in the southern Appalachian foothills of Virginia, the Carolinas, and upper Georgia. It also flourished during the first Great Migration (1910-40) in the Northeast, particularly in Washington, D.C., and Maryland. This genre is distinguished by a more melodic finger-picking guitar style compared to Delta Blues or Acoustic Texas Blues. It features syncopated rhythms derived from Ragtime, clear vocal delivery, and influences from other American Folk Music forms such as Appalachian Folk Music and Traditional Country.

Developing in the early 20th century, Piedmont blues enjoyed a few decades of popularity before declining in the post-World War II era. Although named for the Piedmont region, its defining features were prominent among ragtime blues guitarists across the Deep South.

In the 1950s, Piedmont blues experienced a revival within the folk music scene, gaining a cult following. While it has seen little mainstream success since then, the genre continues to influence Contemporary Folk and various Blues styles, maintaining a dedicated underground following.

Piano Blues 

Piano Blues refers to Blues played on the piano, either solo or with the piano as the lead instrument of a small combo performing slow or mid-tempo blues ballads, as opposed to the commonly fast-paced Boogie Woogie. Influenced by the piano-dominated Ragtime, it is one of the earliest recorded blues genres, coming into being in the 1920s. Piano blues performers often accompany themselves on vocals, lending the genre some similarity to later Vocal Jazz singers performing blues ballads played on the piano.

On the one hand, piano blues laid the foundation for piano playing Rhythm & Blues performers such as Ray Charles or Nina Simone. On the other hand, creating a slow, comfortable and melancholic sound nowadays associated with late night bar rooms, piano blues performers – such as Roosevelt Sykes, Otis Spann or Champion Jack Dupree – had a notable influence on the performance style and sound of singer/songwriters like early Tom Waits and even Randy Newman.

Ambient techno emerged in the late 1980s, blending repetitive techno beats with ambient textures, creating music more suited for home listening than clubs. Key early artists from the British techno scene, including Aphex Twin, crafted mellow, introspective tracks as an alternative to the fast-paced Hardcore EDM dominating UK clubs. In 1992, Warp Records' Artificial Intelligence compilation brought together leading figures, cementing "intelligent techno" (later criticized as an elitist term). In the mid-1990s, Germany’s scene influenced the genre’s evolution, integrating minimalism and dub, notably through Berlin’s Basic Channel and Wolfgang Voigt's work. Ambient techno continues globally, blending past innovations with new influences.

Stomp and holler, a genre of Contemporary Folk that gained mainstream popularity in the 2010s, is defined by strong stomping rhythms, shouted vocal hooks, and a focus on audience participation. Often featuring simple structures, stomp and holler songs are crafted to be catchy and encourage people to join in, with driving beats and repetitive, anthemic choruses designed for stomping and singing along. Influences from Indie Folk are most prevalent, blending its melodic qualities with rustic Americana instrumentation, Gospel and Blues-inspired vocals, and Pop Rock polish. Structurally, stomp and holler has been compared to Alternative Rock due to its dynamic shifts between softer verses and explosive choruses, though it notably favors a polished, commercial production over the raw feel of other indie folk music.

The genre name "stomp and holler" was popularized around 2017 by Spotify’s playlists, though similar sounds had been loosely categorized as “stomp clap” prior, with examples like The Lumineers, Mumford & Sons, Of Monsters and Men, and Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros. While less popular than at its peak, the genre has resurfaced with Noah Kahan’s recent success, which has brought renewed attention. Stomp and holler also shares elements with other 2010s pop rock, as seen in the work of Imagine Dragons, Bastille, and fun., with their emphasis on bold song dynamics and rhythmic stomping.

From southerncrossflutes.com: 
"The Mayan Temple Flute, also known as the Harmony Flute, is a multi-chambered, multi-keyed flute, that has its origins dating back to between 200BCE and 1200CE. Each chamber can be played as a solo flute, alternating between the left and right, or both chambers together. This creates an immersive, harmonious, and highly resonant sound.

This style of flute originated in the Mayan and Teotihuacan cultures, where it was commonly crafted from clay and played by priests and villagers. It has been adapted into a wooden flute that combines the traditional Mayan dual chambered clay flute, with the totem and slow air chamber from the modern Native American Style Flute."

Comfy Synth is an emergent subgenre of Dungeon Synth of the 2020s, characterized by nostalgic, sentimental, and childlike atmospheres that often lend it an amateur quality. With influences from New Age music, it typically features calm, peaceful, or soothing sounds, frequently tinged with melancholy and bittersweet tones. Comfy Synth recordings are often low-fidelity and hazy, embracing minimalist, looping synth patterns and gentle melodies that evoke feelings of simplicity and personal exploration.

This genre’s aesthetic is innocent, sometimes surreal, and often supported by visuals that include cozy imagery: animals, treehouses, fireplaces, donut shops, seaside cottages, and fairy villages. Artists like Grandma's Cottage, Tiny Mouse, The Friendly Moon, and Childhood Memories embody these themes, which often blend real and imagined memories, creating a nostalgic atmosphere that borders on romanticism.

Jazz-funk blends the rhythmic drive and repetitive bass lines of funk with jazz, replacing traditional swing rhythms with a steady groove. This genre often features horn sections playing riffs, lengthy tracks built around a one- or two-chord vamp, and solo instruments like keyboards, saxophones, or electric guitars. Emerging in the late 1960s, jazz-funk drew inspiration directly from funk, unlike its predecessor, soul jazz, which had more influence from Rhythm & Blues and Gospel. The genre embraced electric instrumentation, including guitars, bass, keyboards, and synthesizers, paving the way for later synth funk. Early examples of jazz-funk, like Herbie Hancock's Fat Albert Rotunda and Miles Davis' Bitches Brew, blended funk rhythms with avant-garde jazz. The genre gained mainstream success with Hancock's Head Hunters (1973) and was further popularized by groups like Weather Report. Jazz-funk's influence continued into the 1980s, shaping the development of Acid Jazz and impacting dance and hip hop.

Gil Scott-Heron was an American artist recognized for his work as a jazz poet, singer, musician, and author, particularly during the 1970s and 1980s. He became known for his spoken-word performances, which often addressed social and political issues. In collaboration with musician Brian Jackson, Scott-Heron blended jazz, blues, and soul with lyrics that spoke to the struggles of the time. He coined the term "bluesologist" to describe himself, referring to it as "a scientist who is concerned with the origin of the blues." His iconic poem "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised," which he performed over a jazz-soul beat, is regarded as a significant influence on the development of hip hop music.

Jazz-rock is a genre of rock music shaped by jazz, particularly in its structure and instrumentation. Emerging in the late 1960s, it was pioneered by artists like Soft Machine and Frank Zappa, who crafted long, improvisational jams that often featured traditional rock instruments, though not exclusively. Over time, jazz-rock also evolved into more mainstream, pop-influenced styles, as seen in the work of bands like Chicago and Steely Dan, who incorporated jazz-rock elements within a more accessible framework.

The "Think" break is a famous drum break from the 1972 song "Think (About It)" by soul singer Lyn Collins, written and produced by James Brown, and performed by drummer John "Jabo" Starks. Widely sampled across popular music, this break gained traction after it appeared in 1987 on the 16th volume of Ultimate Breaks & Beats, a well-known compilation for hip hop producers. 

That year marked the first known use of the "Woo! Yeah!" break, sampled in Cookie Crew's track "Females (Get On Up)":
https://youtu.be/PIUMP9xdpGg

The break's popularity surged in 1988 when it was prominently featured as the backing loop for "It Takes Two" by Rob Base & DJ E-Z Rock, a platinum-selling hit composed mostly of samples from "Think (About It)": 
https://youtu.be/phOW-CZJWT0

The "Think" break soon became nearly ubiquitous in late 1980s and early 1990s dance and hip-hop music and remains widely used today. Besides the "Woo! Yeah!" portion, other elements of the break have been popular in various breakbeat genres like jungle, drum and bass, and breakcore, often with the shout sped up for a distinctive sound.


Here's a track from La Toya Jackson's 1989 album Bad Girl, which makes great use of the sample at around 1:31.
https://youtu.be/G1nAzB_WyUE

La Toya Yvonne Jackson is an American singer and television personality. The fifth child and middle daughter of the Jackson family, Jackson first gained recognition on the family's variety television series, The Jacksons, on CBS between 1976 and 1977.

The album blends straightforward but catchy pop hooks and melodies with exceptional electronic production. The song structures feature interesting progressive elements as well. The sound is ethereal, futuristic, and dense, with smooth transitions between tracks. Its nice either as background music or as a more attentive listen.

1427:
Ashkenazi music represents the diverse musical traditions of the Ashkenazi Jews, a group originally rooted in Central and Eastern Europe. These traditions are closely tied to the community's history, marked by migrations from southern Europe during the Roman Empire to the Rhine region in the Middle Ages, and later to Eastern Europe after expulsions. Despite the displacement of Ashkenazi Jews during the Holocaust and subsequent migrations to the United States and Israel, their music remains a vital connection to their European heritage.

Influenced by the musical traditions of their surrounding regions, Ashkenazi music developed distinct forms compared to other Jewish communities, though overlaps exist, such as with Sephardic and Mizrahi music. A hallmark of Ashkenazi music is Klezmer (see entry 899), a secular genre combining Romanian, Greek, Slavic, Balkan, and Romani influences. Originally used in celebrations like weddings, Klezmer became internationally known after being brought to the U.S. by Eastern European Jewish immigrants. 

Ashkenazi music spans both secular and liturgical genres, often reflecting the cultural and religious practices of the community. Liturgical music, typically performed a cappella, includes cantorial music and nigunim, wordless melodies that originated in Hasidic communities. Secular traditions feature Yiddish folk songs and contemporary interpretations blending Western genres like jazz and pop. While Yiddish was historically central to Ashkenazi music, migrations and the Holocaust shifted the focus to English and Hebrew. Today, labels like Tzadik and Jewish Music Group continue to celebrate and innovate within the Ashkenazi musical tradition.

1428:
Chazzanut, or cantorial music, is the traditional vocal art of Jewish liturgy, performed by a chazzan (cantor) to lead synagogue prayers through expressive, melodic chanting. Rooted in centuries-old Jewish religious practices, it evolved significantly in Ashkenazi communities, blending traditional prayer modes (nusach) with Western classical and Christian liturgical influences. By the 18th and 19th centuries, professional cantors incorporated operatic and classical techniques, elevating chazzanut as both a sacred and artistic form.

Distinct regional styles shaped the development of cantorial music, particularly between Western and Eastern Ashkenazi traditions. Western cantorial music, influenced by Christian liturgical elements such as choirs and organs, leaned on the classical German nusach (Minhag Ashkenaz). In contrast, Eastern styles retained strong Hasidic influences, characterized by intense emotional expression, melismatic improvisation, and unique vocal techniques like bent pitches and quarter tones. While Western traditions were more standardized and diminished over time due to historical disruptions, Eastern cantorial music remained dynamic, spreading globally through immigration and cultural preservation.

The "golden age" of cantorial music flourished between the two world wars, as prominent cantors like Yossele Rosenblatt and Zavel Kwartin achieved fame for their virtuosic performances. The genre transcended religious settings, with many cantors gaining recognition through concerts and recordings. Today, chazzanut endures in traditional Jewish communities and continues to bridge Jewish liturgical heritage with its rich musical legacy.

It would be a very brave person who would unequivocally state that any one of the four Kussevitsky brothers, Moshe, David, Jacob and Simcha, was the best.  They were all known for individual qualities and, in truth, each was an outstanding Chazan in his own right.

David certainly had a most unusual voice, and was ...


1429:
Shir Hama'alot, a collection of Psalms (including Psalms 126), is traditionally sung in Ashkenazi Jewish communities before Birkat Hamazon (Grace After Meals) on Shabbat, festivals, and other joyous occasions, such as weddings.

Before "Hatikvah" became Israel’s national anthem, Shir Hama'alot was a serious contender due to its themes of national renewal and hope.

Here's a full translation (New International Version):
When the Lord restored the fortunes of Zion,
we were like those who dreamed.
Our mouths were filled with laughter,
our tongues with songs of joy.
Then it was said among the nations,
“The Lord has done great things for them.”
The Lord has done great things for us,
and we are filled with joy.
Restore our fortunes, Lord,
like streams in the Negev.
Those who sow with tears
will reap with songs of joy.
Those who go out weeping,
carrying seed to sow,
will return with songs of joy,
carrying sheaves with them.


The work won publicity thanks to its rendition by Josef "Yossele" Rosenblatt (May 9, 1882 – June 19, 1933) , who was a relative of Pinchas Minkowsky (1859-1924) of Odessa. Both were important Ashkenazi chazzans and composers, Yossele Rosenblatt was regarded as the greatest cantor of his time.

1432:
Post-grunge is a genre that evolved from grunge, combining its gritty guitar tones and themes with a more polished, melodic, and hook-driven approach. Unlike grunge's raw underground roots, post-grunge often embraces pop rock and arena rock conventions, featuring standard verse-chorus structures and moderate pacing. Vocally, it is marked by the "yarling" style popularized by Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam, along with raspy and more traditional singing. Acoustic elements sometimes accompany electric instrumentation, especially in ballads. Lyrically, it mirrors grunge's angsty and vulnerable themes, exploring similar struggles.

Emerging as grunge waned, early post-grunge acts like Bush, Live, and Foo Fighters (led by ex-Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl) defined its first wave, alongside artists like Candlebox, Alanis Morissette, and Everclear. The genre became a rock-radio staple but faced criticism, often labeled as "butt rock." In the 2000s, a second wave, including Nickelback, Creed, and Three Days Grace, leaned toward hard rock and alternative metal influences. Despite growing mainstream success, post-grunge received mixed reviews and saw a decline in the 2010s as rock's popularity faded. However, it continues to influence modern artists like Hardy and Mammoth WVH.

The Residents are an American art collective and art rock band best known for their avant-garde music and multimedia works. Since their first official release, Meet the Residents (1974), they have released over 60 albums over half a century. 

Here's their 1976 album The Third Reich 'n Roll 
https://youtu.be/frF9yykCIpY

Satirical/parodical experimental rock. The album consists of two 18-minute tracks collaging '60s pop songs into a queasy, messy, soundscape. 

One RYM reviewer (jshopa) puts forward that the tracks seem to highlight the formulaic and propagandistic nature of pop music, which reinforces heteronormative ideals through constant repetition aimed at American youth.

Zydeco is an uptempo dance music that mixes the traditional Black Creole folk and French Canadian derived Cajun Music styles of southwest Louisiana with the sounds of early African American Rhythm & Blues, Blues, Jazz, and Gospel performers. The first recordings were in the late 1920s, but the style gained popularity in the 1950s with Clifton Chenier and Boozoo Chavis.

As in Cajun music, the dominant instrument is the accordion, but zydeco often adds bass guitar, horns, and keyboards to the mix, and typically features heavy syncopation. By the 1940s, the use of rub-boards (aka "washboards" or "frottoirs") had become a popular part of the zydeco sound and the instrument is ubiquitous in modern zydeco bands.

Swamp blues originated in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in the 1950s. It takes influences from Zydeco and Cajun Music, and has a laid-back, relaxed rhythm inspired by Jimmy Reed & Lightnin' Hopkins. Slim Harpo and Lightnin' Slim were the most well-known musicians of this genre, and the sound is readily apparent in Creedence Clearwater Revival.

1436:
 Swamp rock is a subgenre of Roots Rock that incorporates influences from musical styles rooted in the Louisiana region. These influences include the low-toned, reverberated guitar sound of Swamp Blues; the bluesy, uptempo feel of Cajun Music-infused Zydeco; the rhythmic sensibilities of New Orleans R&B; and more guitar-oriented compositions derived from Rockabilly, Country Rock, Blues Rock, and British Invasion bands. Although swamp rock is usually concerned with the realities of the American South and its iconography, and many acts originate from the same area, the style is not region-locked, with some of the most prominent artists hailing from other parts of the United States.

While swamp rock’s origins can be traced back to the Dale Hawkins’ 1950s song “Susie-Q”, the Louisiana singer-songwriter Tony Joe White and the California-based Creedence Clearwater Revival have been described as the pioneers, both incorporating R&B, Country, and Blues elements. Subsequent groups like Little Feat and Redbone further popularized the sound across the United States, but after its modest heyday, swamp rock’s prominence waned as other popular music styles emerged in the mid-1970s. Starting in the early 1990s, the genre experienced a revival in interest, exemplified by the work of Beasts of Bourbon, JJ Grey & Mofro, and post-Acid Bath projects of Dax Riggs.

Dixieland, also known as Hot Jazz or New Orleans Jazz, emerged in the 1910s as one of the earliest forms of jazz. Named after the Original Dixieland Jazz Band, among the first to release commercial jazz recordings, this style influenced notable musicians like Louis Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton, and King Oliver.

Rooted in Ragtime and early Blues, Dixieland emphasized harmonic simplicity and improvisation. Unlike later jazz styles like Big Band, where soloists stood out, Dixieland encouraged all instruments to alternate between solo and accompaniment roles. Its signature sound often featured polyphony, with instruments weaving independent melodies that maintained harmonic cohesion.

Dixieland ensembles were typically small, incorporating piano, trumpet, clarinet, and drums. Instruments like the banjo and vibraphone occasionally appeared, while saxophones were rare. As the style gained popularity, it spread beyond New Orleans but declined with the rise of Swing in the 1930s. Though no longer mainstream, Dixieland’s legacy endures, influencing jazz improvisation and popularizing tunes like When the Saints Go Marching In.

New Orleans R&B stands out from other R&B styles due to its unique rhythmic complexity, influenced by the "second line" tradition of Mardi Gras parades and jazz funerals. This rhythmic element, also found in Dixieland and New Orleans Brass Band music, is a defining feature of the genre. Additionally, New Orleans R&B places greater emphasis on piano and horns than typical R&B.

Pioneering artists like Fats Domino and Lloyd Price in the early 1950s played a key role in shaping the genre and its contribution to the birth of Rock & Roll. The large horn sections and regional ties also made New Orleans R&B an original influence on Ska.

By the 1960s and 1970s, artists such as Irma Thomas and The Meters expanded the genre toward Soul and Funk, shifting focus away from piano and horns. Meanwhile, musicians like Professor Longhair preserved the traditional New Orleans R&B sound, blending it with other local styles like New Orleans Blues.

Dark jazz is a contemporary style that blends traditional jazz instrumentation with a slow, somber tone to create a cinematic, doom-laden atmosphere. Emerging in the 1990s and gaining traction in the 2000s, particularly in Europe, the genre features key acts like Bohren & der Club of Gore and The Kilimanjaro Darkjazz Ensemble. A significant early influence was Angelo Badalamenti’s Twin Peaks soundtracks, starting in 1990, which combined ambient and lounge elements with surreal jazz sounds, shaping the genre’s development.

Heavily inspired by the moody visuals and dark themes of film noir, dark jazz evokes imagery of smoky, dimly-lit clubs and rain-soaked streets. It draws from the crime jazz scores of mid-20th century noir films like Ascenseur pour l'échafaud, The Man With the Golden Arm, and Taxi Driver, but with a much slower tempo and an intensified sense of gloom. The music typically features mournful trumpets, saxophones, brushed drums, electric piano, mellotron, vibraphones, and double bass while omitting the upbeat sections common in big band jazz.

Dark jazz often incorporates eerie textures from dark ambient music and, since the 2010s, electric elements akin to post-rock, as seen in acts like Lowering or Radare. Some artists even blend the genre with post-metal and doom metal influences, adding a further layer of weight and intensity.

Footwork

Footwork, a fast-paced dance and electronic music style, emerged in Chicago's South and West Sides in the late 1990s. Rooted in Ghetto House and Juke, with influences from Hip Hop, it features syncopated rhythms, repetitive samples, skittering drum fills, and sub-bass in place of a 4/4 kick. Typically around 160 BPM, footwork is known for "battle tracks" crafted for competitive dancers, often featuring war-like trumpet sounds. Many producers, like DJ Manny, started as dancers themselves.

RP Boo is credited as the genre's pioneer, shifting away from Juke's 4x4 groove. Early tracks like "Baby Come On" and DJ Clent's "3rd World" helped define its sound. In the late 2000s, compilations like Bangs & Works Vol. 1 & 2 and DJ Rashad’s Double Cup brought footwork global recognition. Chicago crews such as Teklife and labels like Lit City Trax popularized the style further.

By the 2010s, footwork gained traction in Japan and Europe, evolving through artists like Machinedrum, who blended UK Bass influences, and Jlin, who pushed the genre’s boundaries.

Ghettotech

The term "ghettotech", coined by Disco D in 1998, is a style of Electronic Dance Music that emerged from Detroit in the mid-to-late 1990s, which fuses the syncopation and synthesized sounds of Detroit Techno and Electro with the cut-up samples of Ghetto House and fast rhythms of Miami Bass (typically 145 bpm minimum). Innovators of the genre include DJ Godfather, DJ Assault and Disco D.

Ghetto house (AKA Booty House)

By the mid-to-late 1980s, House music was an established and distinct style in Chicago. However, the house sound of names like Frankie Knuckles was played in the northern side of the city, the upscale clubs. In other parts of Chicago (most notably the slums - the ghettos - in the south and the west), a different style of house developed, seen as rougher and more suited to its locale. These tracks were often call-and-response chanted vocals (with heavy use of looped vocal samples), riddled with local slang and references, on top of 4x4 bass lines and uncomplicated drum patterns, usually at 140bpm.

This style, ghetto house, was almost exclusively released on one of the local house labels; Dance Mania, founded just before the ghetto house sound began to emerge. Dance Mania released many classic tracks by ghetto house pioneers, like DJ Deeon, DJ Funk, DJ Milton, and Jammin' Gerald, throughout the nineties.

Genres influenced by ghetto house include the Detroit equivalent, Ghettotech, the combination of Electro with ghetto house. Back in Chicago, the rising tempos of ghetto house led to a new sound, very much in the style of ghetto house but with highly unusual syncopation and a distinctive production sound; Juke.

Juke 

Ghetto House had traditionally been at around 140bpm, but tempos were rising in the late nineties as producers sought new sounds; one of these producers was RP Boo. In 1997 he released a track, "Baby Come On", which is generally considered to be the starting point of the subgenre of juke house. Juke is faster than ghetto house, playing at 160bpm, and makes striking use of unconventional drum patterns which differ wildly from other House styles. It is further removed from its predecessors by the absence of sampled drums and percussion, relying entirely on drum machines for rhythms. The genre also has its own dance style, footwork, which is sometimes used as an AKA for the music.

Since its development the juke sound has been popular in Chicago, but remained mostly just a local scene. However, by the very late 2000s and early 2010s it began to receive international attention, and became increasingly popular and influential in Britain, with some British producers producing juke tracks or combining juke with Dubstep and UK Funky. Notable Chicago juke DJs/producers include DJ Spinn, DJ Rashad, and DJ Clent, and Addison Groove is an example of a UK juke producer.

Britpop

Britpop, a branch of Alternative Rock, emerged in the UK in the early 1990s as a response to both American Grunge's angst and the dreamy, noisy Shoegaze style. It brought back a more traditional Rock structure, blending guitar-driven melodies and pop-friendly hooks with influences from 1960s British acts like The Beatles and The Kinks, 1970s Glam and Punk Rock, and 1980s Jangle Pop. Common features included reverbed lead guitars, acoustic strumming, simple chords, string arrangements, and singalong melodies. Unlike the Baggy scene of the late '80s, Britpop avoided dance rhythms, instead highlighting British working- and middle-class life in its lyrics and image, limiting its appeal in the U.S.

Key bands like Oasis, Blur, Pulp, Suede, and Supergrass propelled Britpop’s mid-'90s success. However, the genre declined after 1997 due to Oasis's poorly received Be Here Now and Blur's shift away from Britpop. The spotlight turned to acts like Radiohead and The Verve, leading to the rise of Post-Britpop bands such as Coldplay and Travis, who softened the style and adopted less British-centric themes.

Post-Britpop

Post-Britpop, a successor to Britpop, emerged in the late 1990s with bands like Coldplay, Travis, Keane, and Snow Patrol. These groups shifted away from the 1960s-inspired sounds of Britpop, drawing instead from alternative and American indie rock, alongside softer styles like acoustic and piano rock. Known for introspective and philosophical lyrics, post-Britpop acts often leaned into ballads with mid-tempo structures, lush string arrangements, and a grand, atmospheric sound influenced by artists like U2 and dream pop.

As Britpop waned in the mid-1990s, many of its key acts disbanded or explored darker, experimental directions, while bands like Radiohead and The Verve gained prominence. Emerging guitar-driven groups embraced a more contemplative style, avoiding the Britpop label. Post-Britpop bands achieved international acclaim in the late 1990s and early 2000s, revitalizing Britain’s rock scene before losing steam in the mid-2000s amid the rise of post-punk and garage rock revivals. However, their influence persisted, shaping indie rock acts like Arctic Monkeys and Bloc Party.

The morality play is a genre of medieval and early Tudor drama. 

Ordo Virtutum (Latin for Order of the Virtues) is an allegorical morality play, or sacred music drama, by Hildegard of Bingen, composed around 1151, during the construction and relocation of her Abbey at Rupertsberg. It is the earliest morality play by more than a century, and the only medieval musical drama to survive with an attribution for both text and music.

A short version of Ordo Virtutum without music appears at the end of Scivias, Hildegard's most famous account of her visions. It is also included in some manuscripts of the Symphonia armoniae celestium revelationum ("Symphony of the Harmony of Celestial Revelations"), a cycle of more than 70 liturgical songs. It may have been performed by the convent nuns at the dedication of the St. Rupertsberg church in 1152 or possibly before the Mass for the Consecration of Virgins at the convent.

Here's a 2012 performance of the play, taking place in the Karthäuserkirche, Basel, Switzerland.

Hildegard von Bingen: Ordo Virtutum



Executive  Producer, Producer: Manfred Ei...


The subject of the play is typical for a morality play. It recounts neither biblical events, nor a saint's life, nor miracles. Instead, Ordo Virtutum is about the struggle for a human soul, or Anima, between the Virtues and the Devil.

The piece can be divided as follows:

Part I: A Prologue in which the Virtues are introduced to the Patriarchs and Prophets who marvel at the Virtues.

Part II: We hear the complaints of souls that are imprisoned in bodies. The (for now) happy Soul enters and her voice contrasts with the unhappy souls. The Soul is too eager to skip life and go straight to Heaven. When the Virtues tell her that she has to live first, the Devil seduces her away to worldly things.

Part III: The Virtues take turns identifying and describing themselves while the Devil occasionally interrupts and expresses opposing views and insults. This is the longest section by far and, although devoid of drama or plot, the musical elements of this section make it stand out.

Part IV: The Soul returns, repentant. Once the Virtues have accepted her back, they turn on the Devil, whom they bind. Together they conquer the Devil and then God is praised.

Part V: A procession of all the characters.

Electronicore is a genre that blends Metalcore and Post-Hardcore with various Electronic Dance Music styles, incorporating sequencers, synthesizers, dance beats, and auto-tuned clean singing, often alongside screamed vocals. It draws influences from Trance, Dubstep, and other electronic genres, frequently shifting between heavy and melodic sections, similar to Melodic Metalcore. This genre is closely associated with the "scene" subculture.

The style gained traction in the late 2000s, with notable pioneers and U.S. bands helping popularize it. The early 2010s saw electronicore's rise, with bands from Europe, the U.S., and Japan achieving success. Over the years, elements of electronicore influenced mainstream rock acts, while bands like Electric Callboy brought the genre renewed attention with recent commercial breakthroughs.

Hands up emerged in Germany in the late 1990s and early 2000s as a melodic, punchy, and upbeat form of Electronic Dance Music, typically around 140 BPM. Rooted in Trance, it draws influence from Euro-Trance, Eurodance, and to a lesser extent, NRG and UK Hard House, with melodies often inspired by German Happy Hardcore. The genre is characterized by prominent supersaw leads, dance-pop hooks, sidechained basslines, and powerful drums, often following a pop-like verse-chorus structure. Synth melodies, often simple and catchy, frequently act as the chorus, with vocals typically reserved for verses. Female or pitched-up male vocals are common, delivering sentimental, emotional lyrics that contrast with vocal trance's more subdued tones.

Hands up gained popularity in the 2000s despite its gradual disappearance from mainstream radio, with German artists like Rob Mayth, Cascada, and Special D playing significant roles in its development. Over time, the genre incorporated elements from UK Hardcore, Jumpstyle, and Hardstyle, influencing and being influenced by these styles. In underground scenes, hands up has merged with trends like Nightcore, Cloud Rap-inspired vocals, and Chillwave atmospheres, creating experimental blends. Though no longer mainstream, it retains a global producer and listener base, with many viewing it as a more accessible alternative to the harsher sounds of Hardstyle, while its influence continues to shape Euphoric Hardstyle and other subgenres.

Indigenous Taiwanese music describes the Traditional Folk Music of the various Austronesian people groups that make up the indigenous population of the island of Taiwan. The ancestors of these people have lived on the island for millennia, long before the Han, who now make up the majority of the population, arrived from Mainland China starting in the 1700s. There are two major groups of indigenous Taiwanese, the “mountains indigenous peoples” who live in the mountainous regions of Taiwan, and the “plains indigenous peoples”, who live in the lowlands and have been much more influenced by Chinese culture. There are between 25 and 32 distinct indigenous Taiwanese people groups all together, who speak around 16 languages today. A few of the larger groups are the Amis, Atayal, Paiwan, and Taroko.

Traditionally, indigenous Taiwanese music is performed communally, alongside activities such as working, ceremonies or drinking, rather than as a musical performance to be listened to by an audience. The music is often primarily vocal based, usually sung together polyphonically as a group. It can either be unaccompanied, or alongside traditional instruments such as wooden percussion, jaw harps, flutes, and rattles. Each ethnic group has different names for each instrument, and may have instruments unique to them.

There is a lazy child named Ibi

His grandmother asked him to

So he quickly ran and got it for her.
He even jumped up and down
and said, " Grandmother, here is the pipe!"

A really lovely set of recordings

David Darling was an American cellist and composer. In 2010, he won the Grammy Award for Best New Age Album. He performed and recorded with Bobby McFerrin, Paul Winter Consort, Ralph Towner and Spyro Gyra and released many solo albums.

The Bunun, also historically known as the Vonum, are a Taiwanese indigenous people. They speak the Bunun language. Unlike other aboriginal peoples in Taiwan, the Bunun are widely dispersed across the island's central mountain ranges. In the year 2000, the Bunun numbered 41,038. This was approximately 8% of Taiwan's total indigenous population, making them the fourth-largest indigenous group. They have five distinct communities: the Takbunuaz, the Takituduh, the Takibaka, the Takivatan, and the Isbukun.

The Bunun are well-known for their distinctive and complex polyphonic singing style

Drumless is a style of hip-hop, that emerged in the early 2010s, defined by minimal or absent percussion, focusing instead on looped samples. Unlike traditional hip-hop, which emphasizes heavy drum beats, this style strips down the music to its core sample without adding drum machines, basslines, or prominent kicks and snares. Any percussion present typically comes from the original sample and is often subdued or filtered.

Early influences trace back to the 1990s and 2000s, with producers like RZA occasionally using simple, looped soul samples with minimal percussion. Madlib and The Alchemist also shaped the style with their stripped-down, soulful beats. Jay Electronica’s Act 1: Eternal Sunshine (The Pledge), featuring drumless film score loops, was another key precursor.

In the 2010s, artists like Ka and Roc Marciano popularized the genre with albums like Grief Pedigree and Reloaded, characterized by unaltered loops of 1970s soul and rock paired with gritty gangsta rap lyrics. The style gained traction among 'coke-rap' artists, including those on Griselda Records, such as Westside Gunn and Boldy James. Producers like The Alchemist, V Don, and DJ Muggs further refined the sound, relying on sparse percussion. Experimental artists like Earl Sweatshirt and Navy Blue also embraced drumless beats, drawing from diverse, unconventional samples.

GUM is a 2020 experimental abstract hip-hop album by Cities Aviv. It makes use of Drumless production.

1476:
Experimental big band music refers to Big Bands who dispense with the traditional Jazz structures and Swing sounds, instead performing Avant-Garde Jazz and pushing the boundaries of the medium.

Radical innovation within the big band line-up had already been attempted with Stan Kenton's Progressive Big Band approach in the 1940s, introducing Western Classical Music compositional techniques and idioms, but not going as far as to fully embrace the avant-garde sounds and influences found in the later experimental big bands. The latter started to emerge in the 1960s and 1970s, with bandleaders Charles Mingus, Bill Dixon, Sun Ra and Don Ellis experimenting with the big band format. Works by these plus others such as The Jazz Composer's Orchestra, Carla Bley, Charlie Haden and Globe Unity Orchestra incorporated influences of contemporary jazz and/or Modern Classical trends, most notably Free Jazz and Third Stream.

In the 21st century, the genre continues to exist and evolve, with bands like Fire! Orchestra, Angles 9 and ... incorporating disparate elements such as distorted Jazz-Rock, Balkan Folk Music and EAI respectively, creating their own unique take on the experimental big band template.

I've been listening to him every so often since I mentioned him on 390. This album isn't one of his best-regarded, but I like it. Contrary to his other, more breakcore-leaning works, this one lies in the realm of ambient and downtempo.

It's a relaxed listen, but it makes great use of texture, which keeps it engaging and interesting.

I'm not a big fan of the vocoded singing on Starlight and Gray Pill, but it's not hard to get past.

"Daisy Bell (Bicycle Built for Two)" is a song written in 1892 by British songwriter Harry Dacre with the well-known chorus "Daisy, Daisy / Give me your answer, do. / I'm half crazy / all for the love of you", ending with the words "a bicycle built for two". The song is said to have been inspired by Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick, one of the many mistresses of King Edward VII. 

It is the earliest song sung using computer speech synthesis by the IBM 7094 in 1961
https://youtu.be/41U78QP8nBk

First computer to sing - Daisy Bell
"Daisy Bell" was composed by Harry Dacre in 1892. In 1961, the IBM 7094 became the first computer to sing, singing the song Daisy Bell. Vocals were programmed by John Kelly and Carol Lockbaum and the accompaniment was programmed by Max Mathews. This performance was the inspiration for a similar scene in 2001: A Space Odyssey.

 Maj7‡9#11‡13 (harmony in 31-edo) 
https://youtu.be/UqiQIhgAgDw

These chords' specific intervals are described in terms of the 31-Equal Temperament tuning, which divides the octave into 31 equal parts instead of the usual 12 in Western music. This allows for microtonal variations and new harmonic relationships not present in traditional 12-tone equal temperament, making it sound "unusual" compared to standard chords.

1486:
The Chicago school of post-rock emerged in the early 1990s, blending Indie Rock and Jazz into a distinct sound within the "first wave" of post-rock. While retaining standard Rock instrumentation, it tends to favor a minimal or acoustic style, incorporating elements like keyboards, brass, or vibraphones, and often evoking a Lounge or Jazz Fusion atmosphere. Influences from Krautrock, Dub, and contemporary Electronic textures are also prevalent. In Japan, the scene was known as シカゴ音響派 (Chicago onkyō-ha), aligning with the Onkyo movement's focus on sonic exploration.

Rooted in groups like Slint and Bastro, the scene grew after members relocated to Chicago. Bastro morphed into Gastr del Sol under David Grubbs, while Pajo from Slint joined Tortoise, the core of the Chicago school. These bands, along with The Sea and Cake, were linked by producer John McEntire, who collaborated with all and worked with other artists like Stereolab. Jim O'Rourke, also key to the scene, led Brise-Glace and joined Gastr del Sol, contributing to a series of solo albums. The Chicago Underground, featuring groups like Isotope 217° and Exploding Star Orchestra, further merged the city's Avant-Garde Jazz roots with post-rock. The scene was supported by underground labels such as Thrill Jockey and Drag City.

Influence spread to acts like New York’s Ui and Toronto’s Do Make Say Think, who were inspired by and performed with Chicago bands. The Red Krayola, with Grubbs, McEntire, and O'Rourke, also became part of this movement. In the post-2000s era, groups like The Eternals and volcano! innovated within the Chicago school, while Tortoise and The Sea and Cake continued their legacy through new releases and touring.

Here's Tortoise's 1998 album TNT

Fascinating take on post rock. Complex and unpredictable, yet full of familiar elements. I love breakbeat rhythms and complex soundscapes of textures, and this has those in spades.

1489:
Brazilian Classical Music

Western Classical Music arrived in Brazil with Portuguese monks in the 16th century. By the 17th and 18th centuries, Minas Gerais became a hub for Brazilian-born composers like José Maurício Nunes Garcia and José Joaquim Emerico Lobo de Mesquita, who followed European styles without local adaptations. In the early 19th century, Opera was dominant, with Antônio Carlos Gomes adding a Brazilian touch to European trends in Joana de Flandres (1863). In 1869, Brasílio Itiberê da Cunha infused Romanticism with Brazilian popular music in Sertaneja, but a true nationalist movement emerged later with Alberto Nepomuceno, Francisco Ernani Braga, and Ernesto Nazareth, who incorporated Maxixe and Choro into classical music.

Heitor Villa-Lobos is regarded as Brazil’s most significant composer, blending Modern Classical with folk influences in Bachianas brasileiras and Choros. The 1922 Modern Art Week promoted the idea that Brazilian music should reflect national identity rather than imitate European traditions.

Contrasting this nationalism, the Música Viva group, formed in 1945 by Edino Krieger and Claudio Santoro, embraced dodecaphonic and atonal techniques. Meanwhile, Camargo Guarnieri’s school focused on historical approaches to Brazilian composition. In 1963, Música Nova emerged, favoring experimental, non-nationalistic styles. By the 1970s, neo-traditional trends resurged, but Brazilian classical music continues to shift between nationalist and avant-garde movements.

Much of Paulinho Nogueira's music (see 254) is a good example of modern Brazilian Classical music. 

Heitor Villa-Lobos (see 304) is another good example. Here's his 12 Études for guitar, performed in 2000 by Norbert Kraft

Here's a track off Pharoah Sanders' 1977 album Pharoah.
https://youtu.be/ii63fKLTSuU
Uplifting Spiritual Jazz 

After leaving the Impulse! label, Pharoah Sanders struggled to find a new label and released this album through India Navigation. The recording process was difficult, with some tracks recorded in a cramped home studio with unfamiliar musicians, leading to his long-standing dissatisfaction with the album. While the production is uneven, Harvest Time is a wonderful 20-minute piece of spiritual jazz, blending saxophone, harmonium, bass, and percussion into rich hypnosis. Initially available only through bootlegs, the album was later given a proper reissue under Sanders’ supervision.

Matsuken Samba II is one of the songs in the “Matsuken Samba” series sung by Ken Matsudaira, a Japanese actor and renowned for his samurai roles.

The Matsuken in the title is a shortened version of the singer's name, a combination of Matsu from Matsudaira and his stage name Ken.

The song was written in 1994 and sung on stage where he performed. When it was first released in 2004, it was a success, ranking high on the Japanese charts and becoming one of the most popular songs in Japan.

Bohuslav Jan Martinů (1890–1959) was a Czech composer known for his modern classical music. His extensive output includes six symphonies, fifteen operas, fourteen ballets, and numerous orchestral, chamber, vocal, and instrumental works. Initially a violinist in the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra, he studied under Josef Suk.

After moving to Paris in 1923, Martinů moved away from the Romantic style and experimented with modern French music and jazz influences, seen in works like Half-time and Kitchen Revue (Kuchyňská revue). In the 1930s, he embraced neoclassicism, developing dense textures and composing prolifically. Notable works from this period include Concerto Grosso and the Double Concerto for Two String Orchestras, Piano and Timpani. His operas Juliette and The Greek Passion are considered his finest, and his use of Czech folk melodies, as in The Opening of the Springs (Otvírání studánek), links him to composers like Prokofiev and Bartók.

Bohuslav Martinů's Puppets (Loutky) is a collection of 14 short piano pieces, composed between 1912 and 1924.

The Concerto Project is a collection of concerti written by Philip Glass. The series was begun in 2000 and contains eight works, the most famous of which is probably the Concerto for Cello and Orchestra.

There are four volumes of the Project:

1.The Concerto Project Vol. I, containing the Cello Concerto and the Concerto Fantasy for Two Timpanists and Orchestra.
2. The Concerto Project Vol. II, containing the Piano Concerto No. 2: After Lewis and Clark, and the Concerto for Harpsichord and Orchestra.

1500:
Death Grips emerged in 2010 as a groundbreaking force in the hip hop world, blending elements of punk, electronic, and industrial sounds to create a unique aggressive and chaotic experimental style. Their raw energy and unorthodox approach quickly garnered a dedicated following. On stage, they were known for their feral intensity - MC Ride’s visceral performances and Zach Hill’s relentless drumming. The absence of a traditional front-facing media presence added to their mystique.

Over their active years, Death Grips released seven studio albums. These brought industrial hip hop, an Experimental Hip Hop genre that uses Post-Industrial beats and sounds, to immense heights of popularity. Their early 2010's albums pushed boundaries in hip hop.

According to a viral post today (2025-02-09), Death Grips' producer Andy Morin allegedly confirmed the group's disbandment, stating, "Yeah it's over." There's been no official public announcement from the band regarding their status. Personally I doubt there will be.

Reading about their apparent disbandment now, years after their last album in 2018, evokes a real sense of nostalgia. It's nice to be reminded of the impact they've had on my enjoyment of music and my taste.

For me, Death Grips was the second band that I really resonated with. Back in high school, I was captivated enough to use "youshouldlistentodeathgrips" as my Instagram handle. Their fourth album, *The Powers That B*, was the first music I ever purchased with my own money.

Fittingly, the first time I talked about them here was on the 15th entry, almost 4 years ago, in which I posted a few Death Grips mashups I liked.

These were my favorite tracks of theirs from over the years:

1505:
Moondog’s 1969 self-titled album is a unique fusion of classical, jazz, and minimalist influences, marked by his unconventional approach to rhythm, which he called "snaketime." Blind since the age of 16, Louis Thomas Hardin developed a distinctive musical style that rejected standard 4/4 timing in favor of complex, flowing patterns. Tracks such as Lament I, ‘Bird’s Lament’ and Stamping Ground highlight his intricate percussion and bold brass arrangements.  

Deeply influenced by Native American rhythms, which he first encountered at an Arapaho sundance, Moondog incorporated unusual time signatures and self-invented instruments like the "Trimba." Though often associated with street performance—earning the nickname "The Viking of 6th Avenue" due to his homemade Viking attire—he maintained relationships with composers such as Philip Glass and influenced the minimalist movement.  

The album, entirely instrumental except for a few spoken-word moments, reflects his ability to merge structured counterpoint with a free-flowing, organic quality. Though initially an outsider, Moondog’s work has since been recognized for its lasting impact on both classical and experimental music.

Te Deum, composed by Estonian-born Arvo Pärt (mentioned on 998) in 1984, is a setting of the Latin Te Deum text, a hymn attributed to Saints Ambrose, Augustine, and Hilary. Pärt's Te Deum plays an important role in Christian services, though its unique instrumentation makes it unsuitable for use in the Orthodox Church.

 It was recorded in 1993 by the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir and Tallinn Chamber Orchestra under Tõnu Kaljuste. The piece, lasting about thirty minutes, is an example of Pärt's tintinnabuli compositional style.
https://youtu.be/jNxbT0MESTY

My favorite modern choral work.

Pärt’s tintinnabuli technique, often described as minimalistic, involves harmonies that deviate from traditional Western classical music. In Te Deum, the music is built around a D triad, with two main voices: the M-voice, carrying the melody, and the T-voice, following the melody with notes from the triad. The work is scored for three choirs—women’s, men’s, and mixed choirs—along with prepared piano, divisi strings, and wind harp. The piano requires four pitches to be prepared with metal screws and calls for a large, amplified concert grand. The wind harp functions as a drone, adding to the piece’s distinct sound. Pärt described the Te Deum text as evoking "immutable truths," aiming to create a serene, infinite mood through the music.

Te Deum shares more similarities with early Christian music than with recent choral works, as its structure mirrors that of Renaissance polyphonic masses, where a chant is followed by its elaboration in multiple voices. The wind harp drone in the piece resembles the ison, or drone voice, found in Byzantine chant, which featured a melody and a constant drone representing an unchanging spiritual reality. Hillier compares this drone to the "spiritual force" uniting the piece and providing its foundation.

The Te Deum hymn begins "Te Deum laudamus", “We praise Thee, O God,” sung at matins or on special occasions such as a thanksgiving.

1509:
Arvo Pärt’s Passio Domini Nostri Jesu Christi secundum Joannem (commonly known as the St. John Passion or simply Passio) is a musical setting of the Passion narrative from the Gospel of John. Composed for solo baritone (representing Jesus), solo tenor (as Pilate), a vocal quartet (Evangelist), choir, and a small ensemble of violin, oboe, cello, bassoon, and organ, the piece has a runtime of about 70 minutes. It follows the Latin text of John 18 and 19, bookended by a brief introduction and conclusion.

Here's the Hilliard Ensemble’s recording here, from 1988:
https://youtu.be/BRrJ2MXwmRQ

Pärt began developing Passio while still in Estonia, taking the initial sketches with him when he moved to Austria in 1980. The composition, deeply rooted in his signature tintinnabuli style, was completed in 1982 and published in 1989. Since then, it has been recorded multiple times and remains among his most well-known works. Much like his broader compositional approach, Passio draws inspiration from medieval musical traditions, particularly the earliest monophonic Passion settings. Structurally, the piece is through-composed, with the Evangelist role performed by an SATB vocal quartet and Jesus and Pilate represented by solo voices. The instrumentation is minimal yet precise, featuring four solo instruments alongside the organ and full choir.

Celtic New Age music is characterized by songs often performed by prominent female vocalists such as Enya and Loreena McKennitt. These songs combine ambient sounds, rhythmic beats, and ethereal vocals, blending elements of Celtic Folk Music with contemporary influences. The compositions frequently evoke pastoral imagery and romantic themes, sometimes drawing on Celtic folklore. In addition to vocal pieces, the genre includes instrumental tracks featuring arrangements of harps, whistles, fiddles, violins, and keyboards. Other notable artists in this genre include Clannad, Llewellyn, Gary Stadler, Secret Garden, and Dagda.

Eithne Pádraigín Ní Bhraonáin, known professionally as Enya, is an Irish singer and composer renowned for her distinctive musical style. With global album sales exceeding 90 million, Enya stands as the best-selling Irish solo artist and is second only to U2 among Irish music acts. Her signature sound is characterized by layered vocals, rich instrumentation, extended reverb, and influences from Celtic music.

Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu (1971–2017), widely known as Gurrumul and posthumously referred to as Dr. G. Yunupingu, was a Yolŋu Aboriginal Australian musician. A talented multi-instrumentalist, he played the drums, keyboards, guitar, and didgeridoo. However, it was his distinct and soulful singing voice that earned him widespread recognition. His songs told the stories of his homeland, performed in Yolŋu languages such as Gaalpu, Gumatj, and Djambarrpuynu as well as in English. He started his musical journey as part of Yothu Yindi before joining the Saltwater Band, eventually gaining broader acclaim as a solo artist. 

At the time of his passing, he was the most commercially successful Aboriginal Australian musician, with global record sales estimated at half a million as of 2020.

Here are two tracks from the 2018 album Djarimirri: Child of the Rainbow, which he was able to finish before he died.

The album is currently ranked #1 for 2025 on RYM. 

I talked about Ichiko Aoba's 2020 album Windswept Adan back on rec 599. 

Though she had long been revered in Japan, her international breakthrough came in 2018 with the Western release of qp, followed by the lush, cinematic Windswept Adan. Her latest album, Luminescent Creatures, expands on this grandeur, trading the dense, foggy forests of Adan for a more open and airy soundscape inspired by the Ryukyu Archipelago. With delicate, intricate sonic details, Aoba crafts music that feels as much like a physical space as it does a listening experience.

Breathtakingly beautiful album. Atmospheric, ethereal, and soft, with rich and warm instrumentation. An album I won't switch off of partway through.

1527:
Gothic country is a subgenre of alt-country inspired by the Southern Gothic literary tradition. It blends dark, atmospheric themes with the sounds of American folk and country music to explore topics like poverty, crime, violence, death, and religion. The genre builds on the alt-country foundation by incorporating instruments such as banjo, mandolin, cello, and accordion, drawing influence from traditional country, old-time, bluegrass, and Louisiana music. It also borrows from post-punk, using melancholic tones and haunting vocal styles, sometimes overlapping with folk punk, neofolk, and freak folk. Themes of faith and mortality further connect it to country gospel, outlaw country, and country blues.

The genre emerged in the 1990s in Denver, Colorado, pioneered by 16 Horsepower and Slim Cessna's Auto Club, both featuring former members of the dark cabaret group The Denver Gentlemen. By the 2000s, the Denver scene—dubbed the "Denver Sound"—produced key gothic country acts like DeVotchKa, Munly J. Munly, Wovenhand, and Tarantella. The style also gained national recognition through artists such as The Handsome Family, Murder by Death, Those Poor Bastards, and Sons of Perdition.

Cabaret is a form of entertainment that blends comedy, music, and dance, typically performed outside traditional theaters. Emerging in late 19th-century France, it became known for its underground, adult-oriented shows held in bars and nightclubs. During America’s Prohibition era, the term was associated with risqué performances like burlesque, often staged in illegal speakeasies with jazz as the dominant musical style.

Cabaret has influenced several major artistic movements, including Dadaism, which originated at the Swiss Cabaret Voltaire in 1916, and the can-can dance, first performed at the iconic Moulin Rouge. In the 1980s, Dark Cabaret emerged, fusing cabaret’s theatrical flair with the brooding sound of gothic rock.


I talked a bit about the composer Kurt Julian Weill back on entry 332.

Dark cabaret is a melancholic, theatrical style of music influenced by traditional cabaret. Its instrumentation is diverse, featuring everything from pianos and synthesizers to violins, cellos, accordions, and both acoustic and electric guitars and bass. The Tiger Lillies, from the UK, were among the first to adopt this style in the mid-1990s, but it gained wider recognition in the early-to-mid 2000s, largely due to The Dresden Dolls.

Here's a 1999 album, Pequeño, by Bunbury, influenced by the style.

Zeitoper was a brief but influential opera movement in Weimar Germany, emerging as part of the broader Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity) artistic movement. These operas, much like opera buffa, featured satirical storylines set in contemporary society but were composed with accessibility in mind. They often incorporated modern technology—such as airplanes, telephones, and elevators—along with references to popular music of the era, including jazz.

As the Nazi party gained power, the movement faced increasing opposition, leading to its decline by the end of the Weimar Republic. Notable composers associated with Zeitoper include Ernst Krenek, Paul Hindemith, and Kurt Weill. The American composer George Antheil also engaged with the style, as seen in his opera Transatlantic, reflecting its international influence.

1531:
Cantus in Memoriam Benjamin Britten is a short canon in A minor, composed in 1977 by Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for string orchestra and bell. It is an early example of Pärt’s tintinnabuli style, which was influenced by his study of early chant music (and which I've talked a little about on 1508). The piece is often noted for its simplicity, built around a single melodic motif and framed by moments of silence at both the beginning and end. However, as critic Ivan Hewett points out, while the concept may be simple, the interplay of musical lines creates a complex texture that challenges the listener’s perception. A typical performance lasts about six and a half minutes.

Pärt wrote the cantus as an elegy following the death of English composer Benjamin Britten in December 1976. Deeply admiring Britten, Pärt described him as possessing a rare "purity" that he also aspired to achieve in his own compositions. Cantus in Memoriam Benjamin Britten is considered one of Pärt’s most well-known works, and a widely distributed 1997 recording by the Hungarian State Opera Orchestra, conducted by Tamás Benedek, helped popularize it. Its atmospheric and cinematic quality has made it a frequent choice for film and television soundtracks.

On 967 I posted a song by Microphones, an American indie folk, indie rock, and experimental project from Olympia, Washington, fronted by Phil Elverum. The project was founded in 1996 and ended in 2003. 

The group had a revival in 2020, during which the album "Microphones in 2020" was released, technically one 44 minute song. 

https://youtu.be/A7BkabF31ak
The album reflects on memory, identity, and the passage of time. It features Elverum’s signature introspective lyrics and minimalist, repetitive instrumentation, blending elements of folk and ambient music. It serves as a meditation and reflection on his artistic journey and personal experiences. It's a powerful, existential album.

The video is striking too. At 36:50 it lingers on a photo of Geneviève Castrée while Phil stops singing. Geneviève Castrée was a Canadian cartoonist, illustrator, and musician. She met Elverum in 2003, and they married the following year. In 2015, they had a child, but shortly after, she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and passed away in 2016.

Crime jazz emerged in the mid-1950s as Jazz music began to be increasingly used in Hollywood Soundtracks. A distinct gritty, moody style developed to accompany the trope of the lonely, brooding, down-on-his-luck protagonist in Film noir movies and hard-boiled detective/crime-themed TV shows.

Unlike Bebop or Cool Jazz, it had a darker, anxious tone, fitting urban post-war settings filled with corruption and danger. The music often featured forlorn trumpet solos, smoky saxophones, punchy brass sections, melancholic piano, and tense percussion for action scenes.

Composers like Elmer Bernstein and Henry Mancini refined the style, with jazz legends like Miles Davis and Duke Ellington later incorporating it into film scores. Crime jazz influenced spy music in the 1960s and continued into the neo-noir films of the 1970s, later serving as a nostalgic reference in games and modern dark jazz.

Here's a track from Murder, Inc., a 1960 album by Irving Joseph, a Bronx-born NYC native who served as conductor for numerous Broadway musicals and plays.

The mod revival movement of the late 1970s and early 1980s, much like the original Mod trend from the 1960s, was more focused on fashion than music. However, a distinct musical genre did emerge as part of the revival. While it shared some characteristics with the original mod style, particularly in its strong rhythm and stripped-down beat influenced by Rhythm & Blues, it leaned more towards British Rock (especially British Rhythm & Blues) than American R&B.

Unlike the 1960s mod, the mod revival music also incorporated significant elements of Punk Rock, and shared some similarities with the Pub Rock, 2 Tone, and second-wave Power Pop genres that were popular in the early days of the New Wave movement in the UK. However, the mod revival was less successful in the US. Some later bands within the movement also experimented with elements of the 1980s Garage Rock revival and Neo-Psychedelia, with the American Paisley Underground scene drawing from many of the same influences.

The Jam was the most dominant band in the mod revival scene, overshadowing other groups such as The Prisoners and The Times, which, despite being notable, did not achieve the same level of popularity or critical acclaim. Interest in mod revival resurfaced in the 1990s with the rise of Britpop, particularly with bands like Ocean Colour Scene, and it also influenced American Indie Rock groups like Chisel during that time.

Go-go is a percussion and drums dominated Funk sound with jam character. In addition, it features horns in the style of James Brown, spare keyboard parts, sampling, and call-and-response vocals and rap. The style utilized heavily syncopated rhythm and typically included three traditional congas and two shorter, 'junior' congas, a line-up virtually unique to go-go.

The style's origins are in mid-1960s African American go-go (simply meaning 'music club') live events and was represented almost exclusively by artists from Washington, DC. By the mid-1970s, the sound was fully formed, the driving influence in its development being Chuck Brown (dubbed "The Godfather of Go-Go") with his band The Soul Searchers. Brown described go-go as a combination of Hispanic American Music beats, African call and chant, and American Jazz.

Go-go continues to expand and influence, with 21st century groups such as TCB and XIB adopting a modern Bounce Beat style, mutating the original go-go into a new sound which is rougher and less melodic.

Converging Ages is a 2008 Progressive Metal/Melodic Death Metal album by Inanna  
https://youtu.be/x6x7lID1T0Q?t=1577

My favorite Metal album at the moment. I don't love the vocals, but I usually don't love metal vocals.

The album is focused on melodic, progressive, and technical elements, but it has strong old school death metal bones that it doesn't try to shake. It starkly contrasts much lighter sections with its heavier, evil sounding riffs (eg. at 28:10) which makes for an entertaining listening experience and a psychedelic, surreal atmosphere.

I forgot to mention this song when I was doing my mandopop recs, maybe I neglected to because I had already mentioned Teresa Teng many times.

"往事只能回味" (Wǎngshì Zhǐ Néng Huíwèi), translated as "The Past Can Only Be Remembered", is a classic Mandarin song from Taiwan's music scene of the early 1970s. It was composed by Liu Jia-chang and written by Lin Huang-kun. The song was first performed by Yao Su-rong in 1970, and later covered by Teresa Teng in 1971.

Rhumba was a popular ballroom dance music style that emerged in the 1930s during the "rhumba craze" in the U.S. It was a commercial adaptation of Latin American genres like Son cubano, Bolero, and Rumba cubana, set in a jazz and pop orchestral context. It became more successful than other imported genres like tango and calypso, with Don Azpiazú’s "The Peanut Vendor" (1930) selling over a million copies. Spanish bandleader Xavier Cugat and his Cuban wife Rita Montaner were key figures in popularizing the genre, particularly on the East Coast.

Rhumba's 2/4 meter set it apart from foxtrot and waltz, integrating well with Samba. Its instrumentation featured a brass section, bass, bongos, and congas, with other Latin percussion instruments like maracas and güiro also common. The genre spread to Europe, influencing bandleaders like Edmundo Ros. By the 1940s, artists such as Desi Arnaz and Miguelito Valdés gained popularity, but rhumba declined by the late 1940s, replaced by Mambo and Chachachá, which dominated American ballrooms before Salsa emerged.

Pub rock is a movement and style of Rock music that developed in the United Kingdom in the early-to-mid-1970s mainly as a reaction to the perceived excess and musical pretension of Progressive Rock and Glam Rock. It emphasises a stripped-down, back-to-basics style of guitar rock that aimed to bring rock 'n' roll away from stadium venues and back to the pubs and clubs of its early years.

Eggs Over Easy and Brinsley Schwarz were precursors to the pub rock scene and paved the way for the genre musically, leading to the development of artists such as Dr. Feelgood, Graham Parker, and Eddie and The Hot Rods. Pub rock shared close ties with Power Pop, and later on, New Wave, with Ian Dury and Nick Lowe being key artists in this area. Another style, also called pub rock, was developed contemporaneously in Australia, pioneered by bands like Aztecs and Buffalo, but it is stylistically distinct and unrelated to English pub rock. English pub rock was short-lived, but proved to be a catalyst for the English Punk Rock movement in the latter part of the decade. The influence of pub rock still reverberates today in bands like The Hold Steady.

1546:
Rawstyle emerged in the early 2010s as a subgenre of Hardstyle, incorporating influences from earlier Hardstyle and Hardcore EDM, particularly Gabber and Industrial Hardcore. This resulted in a darker, harsher, and more simplistic sound, typically with a faster BPM (150-155 BPM) than previous Hardstyle trends. The genre developed partly as a reaction against Euphoric Hardstyle, which emphasized melodic, emotional drops and vocals. Early rawstyle artists sought to revive traditional Hardstyle and Hardcore elements while maintaining the modern EDM production quality and shorter track structures typical of the 2010s.

Characterized by heavily distorted, side-chained kicks, rawstyle focuses on hard-hitting rhythms rather than complex melodies. High-pitched "screeches" accompany the beats, while reverse basslines, aggressive drops, and ominous vocal samples from sci-fi or horror films contribute to its dark aesthetic. Though often criticized for being repetitive and predictable, some producers experiment with unconventional rawstyle variations. The genre’s visual and thematic style often incorporates apocalyptic, horror, or anti-authoritarian imagery to reflect its intense and atonal nature.

Initially championed by labels such as Minus Is More, A2 Records, and Spoontech Records, rawstyle remained popular throughout the 2010s, particularly in the Dutch Hardstyle scene. Key artists include Radical Redemption, Act of Rage, and Warface, among others. The genre has also evolved into even more extreme substyles like "xtra raw" or "uptempo raw," which blend elements of Hardcore and Frenchcore. Conversely, "Rawphoric" emerged as a hybrid of rawstyle and Euphoric Hardstyle, combining harsh kicks with melodic synth leads and vocals.

 Rawphoric is a subgenre of Rawstyle that combines its raw harsher kicks with the uplifting melodies of Euphoric Hardstyle. The genre was originated in the 2010s, after raw and euphoric were settled as two counterparts of the Hardstyle scene, and the tracks are on the average tempo of 150 BPM. Artists such as the duo Sub Zero Project and the producer Phuture Noize were prominent to increase the genre's popularity. Although the term "rawphoric" is not always used (being also replaced with other variations like "euphoraw", "melodic rawstyle" and "euphoric rawstyle"), this new wave of hardstyle DJs and producers blurred the line dividing rawstyle and euphoric hardstyle into a more hybrid and atmospheric sound, which also differentiates it from the "gated kicks" of xtra raw.

1548:
Euphoric Hardstyle emerged in the late 2000s and gained popularity in the early 2010s as a more melodic, lighthearted, and accessible form of Hardstyle. Unlike the raw and harsh elements of traditional Hardstyle, Euphoric Hardstyle emphasizes emotional, cinematic synth leads influenced by Uplifting Trance, Hands Up, and Euro-Trance. The genre is also characterized by weaker kicks, minimal or absent reverse basslines, and a greater focus on melodic drops rather than aggressive rhythms, making it closer in sound to mainstream Electronic Dance Music.

The genre was primarily popularized by Dutch producers such as Headhunterz, Wasted Penguinz, and Atmozfears, alongside Belgium’s Da Tweekaz and Coone. Euphoric Hardstyle frequently incorporates emotional, epic vocals, further differentiating it from the rebellious nature of earlier Hardstyle. While it became the dominant form of Hardstyle during the 2010s, some fans criticized it for being overly "cheesy." Its success coincided with the rise of other melodic EDM styles like Festival Progressive House, Future Bass, and Melodic Dubstep, with frequent genre crossovers into Dancefloor Drum and Bass, Trap, and UK Hardcore. Towards the late 2010s, a substyle known as Rawphoric blended Euphoric Hardstyle’s melodies with Rawstyle’s distorted kicks, adding further diversity to the genre.

Hardstyle originated in the early 2000s in Italy and the Netherlands, evolving from Hard Trance with strong Hardcore EDM influences. It quickly developed into a distinct genre, characterized by a fast tempo (around 150 BPM), heavily compressed kick drums, and the signature reverse bass, which created a unique rhythmic drive. Another defining feature was the screech—a high-pitched, distorted synth that became a staple of the genre. Dutch Gabber, particularly Nu Style Gabber, heavily influenced early Hardstyle, contributing to its aggressive and energetic sound. Around the same time, Belgium’s Jumpstyle emerged as a related but more accessible and danceable genre, drawing influences from UK Hard House and Happy Hardcore. Though Jumpstyle saw commercial success in the mid-2000s, its popularity declined, while Hardstyle continued to evolve.

As Hardstyle progressed through the late 2000s and 2010s, it became increasingly diverse, with producers incorporating elements from other EDM genres. Some experimented with multi-genre tracks that included Hardstyle drops alongside other styles, while others focused on blending Hardstyle’s core elements with emerging dance music trends. This led to the development of Dubstyle, which combined Hardstyle with the wobbling basslines and structures of late 2000s Brostep, as well as Hard Trap, which borrowed Rawstyle’s distorted kicks and aggressive sound design. Another variation, Lento Violento, emerged in Italy, fusing Hardstyle with slower, more atmospheric Italo Dance influences.

These cross-genre experiments helped Hardstyle remain relevant throughout the 2010s, allowing it to influence and be influenced by the broader EDM landscape. Despite changes and offshoots, the genre maintained its core identity, continuing to be a dominant force in the harder styles of dance music while attracting both underground and mainstream audiences.

Contemporary Turkish popular music started in the late 1950s, when Turkish artists started to write their own lyrics to Western popular tunes. Since its inception, Turkish pop music has drawn influences from various musical genres of Western and Turkish origin, including Traditional Pop, Dance-Pop, Arabesk and Turkish Folk Music. 

Sezen Aksu is a Turkish singer, songwriter and producer. She is one of the most successful Turkish singers, having sold over 40 million albums worldwide. Her nicknames include the "Queen of Turkish Pop" and "Minik Serçe" ("Little Sparrow").

The soundtrack, crafted by Sneha Khanwalkar, enhances the 2-minute film’s raw, high-octane energy. Using industrial sounds and rhythmic beats, the music mirrors the power and perseverance the campaign aims to depict.

The duduk is a traditional Armenian double-reed woodwind instrument, made from apricot wood. It has been in use for over 1500 years and is recognized for its distinct, low-pitched tones. The instrument consists of a cylindrical body with finger holes and a large reed, which produces its characteristic tone. It has similarities with instruments such as the Balaban, Mey, Zurna, and Sorna from West and Central Asia, but the duduk's soft, breathy tone is distinct due to its wide reed and cylindrical bore.

Unlike many other woodwinds, the duduk is often played using circular breathing, allowing for continuous sound, and lending a meditative quality to duduk music.

Historically, the duduk has been an important part of Armenian folk music, used in various cultural and social events, including weddings and funerals. The instrument’s sound has also been incorporated into film scores and world music, gaining international recognition. Notable musicians such as Djivan Gasparyan have contributed to its global presence. Today, the duduk continues to be played both in traditional settings and in contemporary compositions.

Djivan Gasparyan (1928–2021) was an Armenian musician and composer known for his mastery of the duduk. He began playing at a young age and became one of the most prominent figures in preserving and popularizing the instrument worldwide. Gasparyan performed both traditional Armenian music and collaborated with international artists across various genres, including Peter Gabriel, Hans Zimmer, and Brian Eno. His album I Will Not Be Sad in This World introduced many listeners to the duduk’s distinctive sound, and his contributions helped integrate the instrument into global film scores and contemporary music.

1562:
Flashcore is a subgenre of electronic music defined by its rapid, erratic structure, abstract sound design, and experimental nature. It features chaotic, staccato layers interwoven with noise, glitch elements, ambient textures, and reimagined rhythms from genres like IDM, Speedcore, and Breakcore. Aesthetically, flashcore leans heavily into futuristic and space-inspired themes, both in sound and visual presentation. While modular synthesis and electroacoustic techniques are common, any method of production can be used to create its intense, complex sound.

Coined by La Peste (Laurent Mialon, AKA Krystal Jesus) in his 2004 Flashcore Manifesto, the genre was envisioned as a break from traditional music, capable of producing immersive and even hallucinogenic experiences. Rooted in France's underground scene in the late '90s and early 2000s, collectives like Hangars Liquides evolved flashcore from hardcore EDM, while artists like Xanopticon pushed its boundaries in North America. Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, figures like Mialon, Jan Robbe, and qebrµs continued developing the genre's abstract and alien sonic identity. In recent years, flashcore has gained a wider presence in experimental music circles, often blending with styles like Extratone and Deconstructed Club, with most modern releases found on Bandcamp.

Here's a 2021 album, For Liza, Beyond the Event Horizon., by Krystal Jesus, pioneer of the genre
https://youtu.be/weYekRewoOE

In many ways the album is flashcore’s magnum opus. 

It is chaotic, complex, mechanical, atmospheric, and highly technical.

Happy hardcore is a high-energy subgenre of Hardcore EDM that emerged in the 1990s. As Breakbeat Hardcore splintered into darker, more complex styles like Darkside and Jungle, artists such as Slipmatt, Dougal, and Sunshine Productions pushed the genre in a more melodic, euphoric direction. They increased the tempo and emphasized upbeat elements like fast 4/4 rhythms, catchy vocals, piano riffs, and spacey effects—giving rise to what was sometimes called "4-beat." This sound developed a strong following in the UK, especially outside London.

As the genre grew, it began to blend with European hardcore styles like Gabber, leading to offshoots such as Scottish Bouncy Techno. Over time, the music leaned more into pounding four-on-the-floor beats, moving away from breakbeats. Popular compilations like Bonkers showcased its evolution, with influences from Eurodance and harder Trance styles. By the early 2000s, this progression led to the birth of UK Hardcore. Despite changes in style, happy hardcore has stayed upbeat and energetic—true to its name. While no longer mainstream, it continues to thrive in underground scenes and has inspired dedicated labels around the world.

I very briefly mentioned the Suona on 234.

The suona, also known as dida, laba, or haidi, is a traditional Chinese double-reed wind instrument with a loud, piercing tone. Its design traces back to ancient Iran, where it was called the "sorna," and it was introduced to China around the 3rd century. The suona remains especially popular in regions such as Shandong, Henan, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, parts of southern China, and the northeast.

Historically, the suona played a major role in northern Chinese folk music, particularly for celebrations, festivals, and military events. It is commonly performed outdoors in ensembles that include gongs, drums, and sheng mouth organs, particularly during weddings and funerals. These groups are known as chuida or guchui ensembles. In Chinese culture, the suona has deep ties to ritual music and has been central to both joyful and solemn Daoist ceremonies.

The instrument also features prominently in southeastern Chinese rituals and has been the subject of research by scholars like Stephen Jones. A well-known piece that highlights the suona is Bai Niao Chao Feng ("Hundred Birds Worship the Phoenix"). Its cultural significance and changing role over time were dramatized in the film Song of the Phoenix.

Here's a performance of the track mentioned, this one arranged by Phang Kok Jun for a 2019 Chinese New Year Concert. Hundred Birds Worship the Phoenix has the performer has the suona player imitating several birds. It's incredible that one instrument can make such an array of sounds.
https://youtu.be/HJ8je96siWA

As both a vessel of tradition and a symbol of innovation, the suona continues to represent the spirit of Chinese folk music. On May 20, 2006, it was recognized as part of China’s national intangible cultural heritage.

Minyue (short for minzu yinyue, "ethnic/national music") refers to modern Chinese music composed for traditional Chinese instruments. It evolved from Chinese folk music and includes both solo and orchestral works, with orchestras modeled after Western symphonies.

The term became widely used after 1949, replacing the earlier term guoyue, which had emerged in the early 20th century to describe modern compositions for Chinese instruments. This musical movement was part of broader modernization efforts after the Qing Dynasty's fall in 1912 and was influenced by the New Culture and May Fourth Movements.

Key figures like Liu Tianhua and Zheng Jinwen expanded traditional ensembles, introduced Western techniques, and formalized music education. In 1953, the China Broadcasting Chinese Orchestra set the standard for modern Chinese orchestras using standardized tuning and newly developed instruments.

During the Cultural Revolution (1966–76), most orchestras were disbanded, and music was politically driven. But in the 1980s, orchestral minyue saw a revival, including in places like Taiwan and Singapore, where it is known as huayue.

Here's 大寨紅花遍地開 : 民族器樂曲 (The Red Flower of Tachai Blossoms Everywhere: Music Played on National Instruments), a 1974 album by various artists. 
https://youtu.be/dhjiJUpYjes

This recording of showcases postwar developments in traditional Chinese orchestral music, using instruments like zithers, lutes, woodwinds, and percussion. Sourced from a vinyl rip, it features pastoral and work-themed pieces linked to rural China. Released by the China Record Corporation during the post-Cultural Revolution era, it differs from revolutionary operas and contrasts with modern, heavily produced versions of the genre.

https://youtu.be/YYGJ8asKiII

The Yellow River Piano Concerto is a work for piano and orchestra arranged by several Chinese composers, including Yin Chengzong and Chu Wanghua. It is based on the earlier Yellow River Cantata by Xian Xinghai.

Commissioned during the Cultural Revolution and originally overseen by Jiang Qing (wife of Chairman Mao Zedong, see rec 581 on Revolutionary opera), the concerto premiered in 1970 and has since gained significant popularity both in China and internationally.

The piece blends a post-romantic musical structure with thematic elements drawn from revolutionary and patriotic narratives. It features prominent and technically demanding piano sections and is intended to evoke the resilience and spirit of the Chinese people, symbolized by the Yellow River and its historical significance.

Oki Kano (加納 沖, Kanō Oki), known professionally as OKI, is a Japanese musician of mixed Japanese Ainu ancestry. He blends the sound of the tonkori with drums, bass, keyboards, and dub influences.

In 1992, Oki received his first Tonkori—a traditional stringed instrument of the Indigenous Ainu people of Sakhalin. At the time, the tonkori was mostly seen behind glass in museums, with few traditional players left. Driven by curiosity and passion, Oki immersed himself in learning the instrument and soon began crafting his own. In 1996, he released his debut album Kamuy Kor Nupurpe. Not long after, he founded Chikar Studio to support fellow Ainu artists and share their music. To date, Chikar Studio has released over 20 albums, including work by renowned traditional singer Umeko Ando and the all-female vocal group Marewrew.

Umeko Ando was an Ainu singer and mukkuri player (a plucked idiophone similar to a Jew's harp). Her participation in Oki Kano's second album Hankapuy, helped her gain recognition.

Here's a track from her 2001 debut album, Ihunke 
https://youtu.be/O6QEOQnfvOs

Here's ウポポサンケ (Upopo sanke), from 2003
https://youtu.be/IYqp2llzBis

Upopo are the everyday songs of the Ainu people, distinct from the more sacred Yukar epic chants. While not overtly ceremonial, Upopo still carry spiritual undertones—they might be sung to ward off evil spirits or as brief prayers during daily tasks. These songs are typically short, spontaneous, and closely tied to specific activities, with their rhythms often mirroring the motions of the work being done. Performed in a polyrhythmic style, Upopo stand apart from Yukar in another key way: they allow instrumental accompaniment. Though often sung a cappella, they can also be accompanied by traditional instruments like the mukkuri (a mouth harp), the tonkori (a plucked zither), or the kacho (a frame drum).

Not a song (but there is some ambient atmospheric audio), but I wanted to briefly talk about this 2021  performance of the opening lines of Under Milk Wood, a 1954 radio drama by Welsh poet Dylan Thomas.
https://youtu.be/XAo5w91G53A

Sheen delivers Thomas's linguistically brilliant and poetic lines with fervent intensity. I find that his performance conjures the imagery evoked by the words perfectly, but I was surprised by his impassioned and urgent take on the delivery. When I read the drama, I felt no urgency, reading instead a dreamlike, soft, lilting cadence. 

Other performances might try to evoke the atmosphere differently, but I'm only impressed by a new angle and a uniqueness to the text.

In any case, its a very emotionally satisfying case for Thomas's verse drama.

Here's another dramatic performance I like. This one is by Orson Welles, playing Sir John Falstaff from the plays Henry IV, Part 1 and Part 2. This performance is of an excerpt of Henry IV, Part 2 in which Falstaff presents a rhetorical celebration or mock-serious encomium, where the speaker humorously glorifies wine as the key to intelligence, bravery, and manhood. In this case, Falstaff is jokingly acting like wine is the most important and noble thing in the world, making it sound grand and heroic - but he’s also kind of being sincere because he really loves wine.

The actual performance starts at 3:50. It's neat seeing him speaking to the audience as himself before the switch, though.
https://youtu.be/VJ6v7GHYDbM
The song introducing him is Greensleeves, a traditional English folk song, one of the first known references to which may be dated back to the 16th century.

Welles is considered to be among the greatest and most influential filmmakers of all time, and among the greatest Hollywood actors of all time. His work as Falstaff is widely regarded as one of his most profound and personal performances, and Welles considered Falstaff "the most difficult part I ever played in my life" and referred to him as "Shakespeare's greatest creation." 

Welles masterfully balances Falstaff's boisterous humor with a deep sense of vulnerability. His performance captures the character's exuberant wit and zest for life, while also revealing the underlying sadness of a man facing the loss of friendship and the passage of time.

Critics have noted the parallels between Welles and Falstaff, both being larger-than-life figures who experienced betrayal and decline. Roger Ebert observed that Welles was "born to play Falstaff"

1578:
Here's a brief breakdown of one of my favorite classical pieces, Verklärte Nacht, Arnold Schönberg's (mentioned on rec 789)
https://youtu.be/5Hgq0zyXkIo

Verklärte Nacht was controversial at its 1902 premiere due to its advanced chromatic harmony and a specific "nonexistent" chord that led to its rejection by the Vienna Music Society. Some also objected to the use of Dehmel's poem, which touched on themes like premarital sex, but despite the backlash, Schoenberg was praised for his inventiveness, and Dehmel himself admired the musical interpretation.

Here's the poem the piece is based on:
Two people are walking through a bare, cold wood;
the Moon keeps pace with them and draws their gaze.
The Moon moves along above tall oak trees,
there is no wisp of cloud to obscure the radiance
to which the black, jagged tips reach up.
A woman's voice speaks:

"I am carrying a child, and not by you.
I am walking here with you in a state of sin.
I have offended grievously against myself.
I despaired of happiness,
and yet I still felt a grievous longing
for life's fullness, for a mother's joys
and duties; and so I sinned,
and so I yielded, shuddering, my sex
to the embrace of a stranger,
and even thought myself blessed.
Now life has taken its revenge,
and I have met you, met you."

She walks on, stumbling.
She looks up; the Moon keeps pace.
Her dark gaze drowns in light.
A man's voice speaks:

"Do not let the child you have conceived
be a burden on your soul.
Look, how brightly the universe shines!
Splendour falls on everything around,
you are voyaging with me on a cold sea,
but there is the glow of an inner warmth
from you in me, from me in you.
That warmth will transfigure the stranger's child,
and you bear it me, begot by me.
You have transfused me with splendour,
you have made a child of me."

He puts an arm about her strong hips.
Their breath embraces in the air.
Two people walk on through the high, bright night.

The Lark in the Morning is an English folk song. It was moderately popular with traditional singers in England, less so in Scotland, Ireland and the United States. It starts as a hymn to the ploughboy's life, and often goes on to recount a sexual encounter between a ploughboy and a maiden resulting in pregnancy.

Here are two Irish group's recordings of the songs to compare:

Here's The Johnstons version, released in 1969.

1586:
The Hoboken sound refers to a music scene centered around Hoboken, New Jersey, which gained prominence in the late 1970s through the early 1980s, starting with the opening of the Maxwell's venue. The style was a blend of uptempo Post-Punk, jerky New Wave, Power Pop, and Garage Rock, influenced by East Coast songwriters like Lou Reed and Jonathan Richman, as well as the CBGB Punk scene in New York City. This sound played a key role in the development of early American Jangle Pop and Alternative Rock scenes across the country, and Maxwell's became a hub for "college rock" acts. Local journalists coined the term "Hoboken sound," and the scene even received an hour-long documentary in 1985.

Maxwell's was central to the scene's history, with the first performance by the group "a" and the rise of notable bands like The Individuals and The Bongos. The Feelies, from nearby Haledon, also gained a following, releasing their influential debut Crazy Rhythms in 1980. Chris Stamey, leader of The dB's, was another key figure in the scene, as were bands associated with his label, Coyote Records, including Stamey’s solo work and the Feelies' offshoots.

In the mid-1980s, Glenn Morrow from The Individuals formed Rage to Live, whose debut album marked the start of Bar/None Records, a label that helped further the scene. The late '80s saw a resurgence, with The Feelies reuniting and Yo La Tengo gaining national acclaim. Though the Hoboken sound faded by the early 1990s, both The Feelies and Yo La Tengo continued to be active, with Yo La Tengo gaining significant indie success. Maxwell's closed in 2013, briefly reopening under new ownership from 2014 to 2018.

Porn groove is a music genre most famously associated with the soundtracks of pornographic films from the 1970s. Its purpose was to sonically mirror the rhythm, mood, and eroticism of the on-screen action, often compensating for the lack of dialogue or diegetic sound.

The signature element of porn groove is the use of electric guitar with a wah-wah pedal, delivering a sleazy, expressive lead melody. Supporting elements typically include funk-inspired slapped bass, minimalist drum kits with prominent rimshots, and a loose, improvisational feel.

Many of these films were shot on Super 8mm film, a format widely used from the late 1960s to early 1980s for low-budget and amateur productions. While Super 8mm could technically support sound, the cost and complexity of sound film and synchronized editing kept most productions silent - especially short loops intended for peep shows. As a result, the soundtrack became essential, not just for mood but for narrative, leading to the creation of these richly textured, groove-heavy instrumentals.

Les Filles de Illighadad is a groundbreaking Tuareg band founded by Fatou Seidi Ghali in the village of Illighadad, Niger. Ghali is widely recognized as the first Tuareg woman to play the guitar professionally, defying cultural norms where women traditionally performed tende—a percussive music using a drum made from mortar and pestles—but not guitar. Teaching herself on her brother's guitar, Ghali blended tende rhythms with guitar melodies, creating a unique sound that honors and reimagines Tuareg musical traditions. Alongside her cousin Alamnou Akrouni and other members, Ghali formed the band to showcase this fusion and highlight women's role in Tuareg music innovation.

Les Filles de Illighadad have released several albums through the Sahel Sounds label, with recordings captured outdoors in their village and during performances abroad. Their growing acclaim led to European and U.S. tours, including a notable live album recorded at Pioneer Works in Brooklyn in 2019. Critics describe their music as meditative, spiritual, and emotionally rich, drawing comparisons to American blues traditions rooted in West African rhythms. Their work has been praised for preserving the essence of village life while evolving Tuareg music into a powerful new form.

Two A minor piano concertos:

Piano Concerto in A minor, Op. 7 by Clara Schumann (1835)
https://youtu.be/Xol1DKul984
Piano Concerto in A minor, Op. 54 by Robert Schumann (1845)
https://youtu.be/Ynky7qoPnUU

Clara and Robert Schumann were two artists shaped by love, collaboration, and very different societal expectations. Clara, one of the 19th century’s most gifted pianists, completed her concerto at fifteen in 1835 while under the intense tutelage of her father, Friedrich Wieck. Already performing across Europe, she was encouraged to write music that showcased her virtuosity. But after her marriage to Robert, her creative energy was largely diverted by rearing 8 children, touring, and supporting Robert’s career. She never wrote another concerto.

Robert composed his concerto over several years, beginning with a one-movement fantasy in 1841 and completing it in 1845. He, too, wrote only one piano concerto, not out of constraint, but because he turned to other forms: symphonies, chamber music, and song cycles. Clara premiered his concerto and was its most committed performer.

Clara’s concerto is compact, lyrical, and bold for its time, particularly in the second movement’s duet between piano and solo cello. Robert’s is more orchestral and integrated. his goal was not bravura but dialogue. 

Traces of Clara’s influence are embedded in his work. Sketches she played for him often found their way into his pieces. Though their musical legacies are entangled, she was rarely credited. 

Robert’s concerto became a fixture of the canon. Clara’s, though admired at its debut, faded, a victim not of musical quality but of structural barriers. Her concerto deserves recognition not just as a major early Romantic achievement, but as a document of artistic agency under constraint. Her work speaks to influence, authorship, and legacy, and reminds us how easily certain voices are sidelined, not because they lacked vision, but because they weren’t expected to speak at all.

There is strong and well-documented evidence that Clara and Robert Schumann were deeply in love, though their relationship was also marked by tension, sacrifice, emotional complexity, and the societal standards of the time.

Clara and Robert first met in 1828 when Clara was just 9 years old and Robert was 18. Clara, already a child prodigy under the strict tutelage of her father, Friedrich Wieck, was introduced to Robert through her musical circle. Over the years, their relationship evolved from mentor and student to romantic partners. By 1837, Robert proposed, but Clara’s father fiercely opposed the union, leading to a lengthy legal battle. In 1840, Clara won her independence in court and married Robert shortly after, a bold and risky decision for a young woman in 19th-century Germany.

Their letters are filled with affection, emotional vulnerability, and longing, particularly during the years they were forced apart by Wieck. Robert composed many works with Clara in mind, including Widmung (Dedication) and his Piano Concerto. In the Concerto, the theme of Eusebius references Clara directly through the notes C-H-A-A (the Italian spelling of her name, Chiara).

Clara, in turn, was a key performer of Robert’s works and often promoted them throughout her career. Their joint diaries show a partnership rooted in mutual respect, emotional support, and artistic admiration. However, the diaries also reveal Clara’s internal conflict, as her own career became secondary to Robert’s, particularly as they raised eight children together.

The 8-year age difference between them, Clara being younger and just beginning her career when they married, adds a layer of complexity to their dynamic. Robert was already an established figure in the music world, while Clara was still emerging as a composer. Though deeply in love, their relationship invariably placed Clara’s personal ambitions on hold, overshadowed by the demands of supporting Robert’s career.

Nature Recordings are recordings of natural phenomena such as waterfalls, ocean waves, and storms, as well as animal sounds. 

Soundscape ecologists break down natural sounds into geophony and biophony. Geophony refers to natural sounds produced by non-living things such as the movement of air, water, and rocks. Common examples of geophony are wind, lightning, waterfalls, ocean waves, and avalanches. Biophony refers to non-human biological sounds and are comprised mostly of Animal Sounds. Sounds produced by humans, anthropophony, is a third component of soundscapes that is not included among natural sounds. These 3 classifications are not strictly separate, as one type of sound can be altered by the presence of objects characteristic of another type of sound. For example, the sound of wind will be different when it is blowing through tall grass, through tress, across a barren landscape, or through a city.

2. Congaree Nomads – Built from 24 three-minute field recordings taken by Pisaro and Greg Stuart along trails in the park. The piece traces a slow, sonic journey from Cedar Creek to the Congaree River, layered with instrumental harmonies (“fogs”). (GW 012)

3. Anabasis – A composition in 72 parts for five musicians, inspired by four elemental materials: Sand, Wind, Tone, and Wave. Alongside Pisaro and Stuart, performers include Patrick Farmer, Joe Panzner, and Toshiya Tsunoda. (GW 013)

Together, these works explore how the apparent sonic continuum of the world is actually composed of fragile, shifting states — a study in “discrete continuity” and contingency.

Metalcore is a fusion of Hardcore Punk and Metal that emerged in the early 1990s, known for its heavy, drop-tuned guitars, double kick drumming, and harsh vocals. A defining feature is the breakdown, a rhythm-heavy section emphasizing slow, percussive playing. Early bands like Integrity and Earth Crisis were influenced by Crossover Thrash and New York Hardcore, with later shifts toward Thrash and Groove Metal, especially drawing from Slayer's style.

In the late 1990s, Melodic Metalcore (e.g., Shadows Fall) incorporated Melodic Death Metal influences, while Mathcore (e.g., Converge) introduced technical complexity. Deathcore emerged by blending metalcore with Death Metal.

The 2000s saw metalcore's mainstream rise, with bands like Killswitch Engage, Bullet for My Valentine, and Bring Me the Horizon gaining major followings. Crossovers with Post-Hardcore, Emo, and Progressive Metal became common, and subgenres like Electronicore, Easycore, and Nu Metalcore appeared.

Since the 2010s, metalcore's popularity declined in the mainstream as some bands moved to lighter styles. However, a revival of heavier metallic hardcore acts like Knocked Loose and Code Orange gained critical acclaim.

The previous track was part of the Straight edge movement that emerged from the early 1980s Washington, D.C. Hardcore Punk scene, promoting abstinence from alcohol, tobacco, and drugs. Some adherents also avoid casual sex, caffeine, and promote veganism and animal rights. The term comes from Minor Threat's 1981 song “Straight Edge.” The movement is symbolized by an X, often marked on hands or tattooed.

Early bands include 7Seconds, The Teen Idles, and SS Decontrol. The mid-1980s saw the rise of Youth Crew, a New York-based submovement emphasizing unity and positivity, with bands like Youth of Today and Gorilla Biscuits. Other offshoots included Krishnacore (e.g., Shelter) with spiritual themes, and Hardline, a more militant, eco-vegan branch. International scenes also emerged, such as H8000 in Belgium and Umeå Hardcore in Sweden.

Straight edge influenced the development of Metalcore in the 1990s, with bands like Earth Crisis. While the movement declined in popularity by the late '90s, it continues through modern bands like Have Heart and One Step Closer.

Here's another album influenced by the movement, War by Sentence, from 2002

1605:
Beatdown hardcore is a form of Hardcore [Punk] originating from the New York Hardcore scene, closely related to Metalcore. Early predecessors such as Breakdown and Outburst incorporated metallic mid-tempo grooves, urban aesthetics and heavy breakdowns into hardcore, leading to bands such as 25 ta Life and Bulldoze (who also named the style) to establish beatdown as a genre by emphasizing these elements.

Beatdown bands often incorporate Hip Hop influenced vocals that can vary from a rap-inflected delivery to full on rapping, extended spoken mosh calls, simplistic heavy chug grooves, chromatic slam riffs akin to Slam Death Metal and an excessive amount of breakdowns. It is common for bands to use graffiti imagery in their logos and artwork, and their lyrics are generally written with a "tough guy" demeanor. In the late 1990s and early 2000s bands such as No Retreat and One Second Thought pushed the genre into an even more metallic direction by utilizing a significant influence from Death Metal.

In the early to mid-2010s, bands such as No Zodiac and Mercy Blow fused elements of beatdown with slam death metal in a style commonly known as slamming beatdown. In the late 2010s beatdown had a resurgence in popularity with bands such as Sunami, Three Knee Deep and Never Ending Game being significant artists in the hardcore scene.

Crossover thrash is a fusion of Thrash Metal and Hardcore Punk, with the term 'crossover' denoting an in-between of the two genres. Crossover thrash typically features briefer, less technically demanding arrangements than other forms of thrash metal, borrowing more directly from the straight-ahead approach of Punk. Crossover thrash mostly utilizes shouted vocals. Lyrically, crossover thrash focuses on sociopolitical matters and/or rebellious themes similar to those of punk.

The etymology of the term 'crossover' thrash is commonly attributed to D.R.I.'s second album: 1987's Crossover. On the record, D.R.I. made a transition from the hardcore punk subgenre Thrashcore to a more metal-informed sound. The hardcore punk group Suicidal Tendencies similarly shifted to a more metallic sound while retaining their hardcore roots on their sophomore record: 1987's Join the Army. While not necessarily a crossover thrash group, "big four" thrash metal band Anthrax similarly contributed to the mixture of sounds; additionally, Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian formed the crossover thrash project S.O.D.. The New York Hardcore scene made key contributions to crossover thrash, with notable groups such as Agnostic Front and Cro-Mags further popularizing the style. Crossover thrash would wane in popularity as thrash metal was overshadowed by other styles during the 1990s, however, it influenced later Hardcore [Punk]/Metal fusions, most notably Metalcore. Crossover thrash would also make a modest comeback in the 21st century with groups such as Municipal Waste and Power Trip (the latter of which received critical acclaim).

Melodic metalcore is a subgenre of Metalcore which originated in the late 1990s when some metalcore bands began to infuse elements of Melodic Death Metal into their sound to create a more metallic and melodic style.

The genre was pioneered in the late 1990s by bands such as Shadows Fall, and Undying. These bands combined the metalcore style of the time with various elements of melodic death metal including melodic riffing, blast beats, and melodeath-style screams and growls. This style gained mainstream popularity through the success of Killswitch Engage, paving the way for bands such as Atreyu, As I Lay Dying, God Forbid, and Avenged Sevenfold in the early 2000s. As the decade progressed, melodic metalcore continued to be popular, with bands such as All That Remains, Trivium, and Bullet for My Valentine bringing a sound prioritizing melody even more to the genre.

Melodic metalcore’s popularity waned in the late 2000s as the mainstream metalcore audience pivoted towards other styles. Some newer bands, such as Miss May I and Parkway Drive, found success in the genre, but many bands transitioned into different styles, with many older melodic metalcore bands embracing Heavy Metal and Alternative Metal, and many newer melodic metalcore bands transitioning back to regular metalcore.
