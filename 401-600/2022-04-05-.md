Wildflower is an album by The Avalanches, recorded from 2000-2016. For the most part, its their typical Plunderphonics, Neo-Psychedelia style. I can't imagine there are many people who haven't already heard this one, "Because I'm Me" with 42 mill views on YT.

Here's another track from the album, If I Was A Folkstar:

This is the third time I've mentioned The Avalanches (7 song recs total, see 328 and 328.5), which maybe goes to show how one-of-a-kind their sound is.
