Wikipedia: "Angel Bat Dawid is a Black American composer, clarinetist, pianist, vocalist, producer, educator & DJ. Her critically-acclaimed album, The Oracle, has been featured in Pitchfork, BBC, Rolling Stone, The Guardian, The Washington Post, The New York Times, and The Chicago Sun Times."

Her music belongs to the genres of Spiritual Jazz, Free Jazz (listen to the live performances), Avant-Garde Jazz, and Chamber Music.

She doesn't do her live performances alone, but (I've heard) on this album she actually records all the voices and instruments, except the drums on "Cape Town", by herself.

Very very soulful.

 Angel Bat Dawid - What Shall I tell my Children who are Black

I think we might have read that poem in Mr. Kelly's English class, but I can't say for sure.
