Of course, it's different hearing them without the accompanying bgm of the area, but they remain interesting. Here's are some great covers of a couple pieces from the soundtrack, on violin, by Shurai-Yue:
 【Elden Ring】《Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon》— Violin cover

 【Eldon Ring】Regal Ancestor Spirit—King of ancestral spirits Violin ...
