Zeuhl

Zeuhl is a style of Avant-Prog created by Christian Vander, founder of the French band Magma, in the early seventies. With the band, Vander fused Jazz, Progressive Rock and Modern Classical music and constructed a language of his own, called Kobaïan, from which the genre takes its name ("Zeuhl" can be translated as "celestial"). Greatly ambitious in scope, Zeuhl often uses large ensembles and choirs to create heavily disciplined, majestic music, often incorporating lyrics in Kobaïan. Originally, the term "Zeuhl" only referred to Magma, but a great number of modern bands have also been given this label, such as Japan's 高円寺百景 [Koenji Hyakkei] and Ruins.

Here's a full album from Magma, released 2004, "K.A".

This first track on this one quickly became one of my favorite Prog-Rock songs right after hearing it for the first time. The rest of the album, which runs for just under 50 minutes, also had me pretty hooked from start to finish. While arguably not as creative or original as Frank Zappa's stuff from previous, this is really the type of Prog I can get behind. If the first 5 minutes don't sell you, the rest probably won't either.
