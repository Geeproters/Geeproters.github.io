Crystal Castles was one of the bands that got me, and tons of others into electronic music for the first time. Specifically, they brought synthpop, bitpop, and even witchhouse to mass audiences. In 2017, Alice Glass accused Ethan Kath of sexual, physical and mental abuse in explanation of her departure from the band. Its now pretty difficult to enjoy their music knowing what was happening at the time, and especially considering Kath remaining unconvicted despite significant evidence of abuse. Regardless, they were an important band for electronic music.
