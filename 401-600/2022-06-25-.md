大石昌良 [Masayoshi Oishi] is a J-Pop artist. A lot of his songs are used as anime openings, here are two:
 君じゃなきゃダメみたい

 恋はエクスプロージョン

Used for Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun and Love After World Domination, respectively. Catchy and uplifting, with some really well-incorporated influences from various western musical styles but otherwise not too interesting.
