Last time I mentioned Arca was on rec 31. One of my favorite electronic albums of all time, &&&&&. It would seem that I should have listened to the rest of her stuff earlier. This time I'll give a little more description. Alejandra Ghersi Rodr√≠guez, known professionally as Arca, is a Venezuelan musician, singer, composer, rapper, record producer and DJ based in Barcelona, Spain. She has released eight studio albums, including Arca and the Kick quintet, starting with Kick I. Most of her music is experimental Latin electronic. She takes influence from dub, hip-hop, grime, ambient music, trap, industrial percussion techniques and post-industrial, and glitch pop. As I said last time, its dense, distorted, and dark. This track is from her self-titled album Arca from 2017.

Just great stuff. The rest of the album is just as good, but I'll limit it to this track, my favorite, to keep it digestible.

This album in particular makes a lot of use of traditional Latin singing styles. Seen some very mixed reception due to the LGBT themes. What with Venezuela being the way it is.
