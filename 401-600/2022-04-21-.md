Future Garage is a derivative genre of UK Garage, combining influences from the rhythms of late 1990s and early 2000s 2-Step with novel moods and production approaches, commonly featuring jittery, broken rhythms, vocal chops, and warm synth pads and plucks. UK Garage is an EDM genre featuring shuffling rhythms and influences from sources including Contemporary R&B and Hip Hop, as well as many forms of Electronic. It evolved out of the early 1990s Garage House scene, which in turn evolved from House. It shares some similarities with Outsider House, which I mentioned about a month ago. Untrue is a 2007 Future Garage album from Burial, also belonging to the genres of dubstep and ambient. This album spawned a following for the microgenre or musical aesthetic of "Burialcore", alternatively termed "Ambstep", combining elements of dubstep and ambient. Here are a couple of my favorite tracks off it, with Archangel being his most popular track in general, and particularly worth a listen.

The rest of the album is similarly atmospheric, dark, and rhythmic. Others describe the sound as "urban".
