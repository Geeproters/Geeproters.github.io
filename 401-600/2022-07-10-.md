The soundtrack for Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike - Fight for the Future was released the year 2000. composed by 奥河英樹 [Hideki Okugawa], it belongs to the genres of Breakbeat, Acid House, and Acid Breaks, as well as Instrumental Hip Hop, Drum and Bass, Acid Jazz, and Japanese Hip Hop.

Acid breaks is a subgenre of Breakbeat characterized by prominent repetitive, "squelching" sounds using a resonant low-pass filter and additional distortion, originally from the Roland TB-303 bassline synthesizer. It reproduces a similar effect to Acid House and Acid Techno, but features intense, syncopated, broken rhythms instead of four-on-the-floor drum patterns. It typically has a tempo around 120-140 BPM. In order to further emphasize the trippy atmosphere, the genre also commonly incorporates arpeggiation and gate effects. The album is a common favorite, soundtrack or otherwise, among breakbeat enthusiasts. There are roughly 30 tracks, but this one's my favorite:
