This'll be the last "Arabic Jazz" rec from the vicinity for a while. This one is more Oriental Jewish Music (describes music that comprises the many traditions and styles of the various groups of Jews from the cultural East, loosely covering the Jewish groups of the Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia) But then, its likely even closer to Post-Bop which grew out of Hard Bop in the early to mid-1960s incorporating certain untraditional elements inspired largely in part from Avant-Garde Jazz, Modal Jazz and eventually, Free Jazz, such as non-diatonic chord progressions, irregular rhythms and amelodic forms. From the 2006 album "Continuo" by Avishai Cohen
