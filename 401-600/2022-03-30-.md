Arabic Jazz is, as expected, a blending of Arabic Music and Jazz. It has a high level of improvisation, and the repertory of instruments consists of typical Jazz instruments, especially saxophone, as well as the Arabic oud. Some of the most important artists are Ahmed Abdul-Malik, Anouar Brahem, and Rabih Abou-Khalil. Here's one album, Salah Ragab And The Cairo Jazz Band ‎– Egyptian Jazz (recorded 1968-1973)

I wouldn't listen to this particular album for musical enjoyment, but it has various aspects that make it interesting. Here's another, Roots & Sprouts from Rabih Abou-Khalil, from 1990

This one I wholeheartedly enjoy for its musical elements.
