Animal Collective is an American experimental pop band formed in Baltimore, Maryland in 2003. Here's one of their more popular tracks. Worth a listen, but despite their recognition and popularity, I wouldn't particularly recommend their other music (the rest of the EP is pretty good though). More in the realm of Psychedelic Folk and Neo-Psychedelia. Some really nice field recordings of nature.
