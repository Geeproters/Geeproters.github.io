–ü–æ–ª—å–æ–≤—ñ –ó–∞–ø–∏—Å–∏ –∑ –õ—é—Ç–æ–≥–æ (Field Recordings of February) is an album by Ukrainian artist Adaa Zagorodnya, released April of this year. Words on the album from the artist himself: "Hello! My name is Adaa Zagorodnya, musician and artist from Kyiv, capital of Ukraine. This little album called "–ü–æ–ª—å–æ–≤—ñ –∑–∞–ø–∏—Å–∏ –õ—é—Ç–æ–≥–æ" which translates from Ukrainian as "Field Recordings of February" is 2-part album, where the first part captures a peaceful life before Russian invasion to my hometown. This part ends with a voice of little girl in a bomb shelter trying to find her mom I recorded on a third day of war. Second part is recordings made during war. They include sound of phone call between me and my little sister on a first day of war, recordings of bombing of Mariupol (city which had been absolutely destroyed by Russians, where about 20000 died) and ends with air siren that I recorded just on Easter" 

This album might not be well suited for active listening, but it is very successful at building an ambient atmosphere. 

Most importantly, the content matter is powerful. Heavy stuff. As one commenter said: "This is the type of album you can't judge for its musicality, but for the experience"
