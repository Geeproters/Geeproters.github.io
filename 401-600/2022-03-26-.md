Coldwave originated in Europe in the late 1970s and early 1980s and is known for its generally dark, gloomy atmosphere and heavy reliance on synthesizers. Here's one song in such a style, from John Maus' A Collection of Rarities and Previously Unreleased Material:
 John Maus - Bennington (Music Video)

Could also be described as Synthpop, Hypnagogic Pop, and Minimal Synth. Hypnagogic pop originated among 2000s underground artists referencing the sounds of 1970/1980s pop culture through hazy, low-fidelity production.
