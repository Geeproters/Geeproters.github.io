Dj CUTMAN is the founder of video game music ensemble GameChops. He's also produced various solo works, mostly consisting of remixes for video game music. I'll save that stuff for a different time, however. This rec seeks to speak of an alias of his, Bird Boy. As he describes it, "Bird Boy is like Dj Cutman but the chiptunes are bird sounds!" Some have described the sound as "Chirp tunes." lmao

He's also got one for the Baltimore Oriole, as well as the Eastern Phoebe This type of music is in some ways similar to the electroacoustic manipulation of birdsong as described in rec 508 with "Lovregana: Music From a Tasmanian Forest". These works, however, feature a more danceable, maybe less experimental, lofi hop-hop take on the concept. A fairly novel idea executed well.

these lil guys are so round
