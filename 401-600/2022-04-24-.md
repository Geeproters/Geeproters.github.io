Peking opera, or Beijing opera, is likely the most dominant form of over 300 types of traditional Chinese opera. It typically combines combines music, vocal performance, mime, dance and acrobatics, and features four main role types: male (sheng), painted-face male (jing), female (dan), and clown (chou). There a lot to say about it, but I don't wanna write a lot so instead here's a small part of one performance.

Here's a song originally from Peking Opera that became a meme.

Here's an actual operatic performance of it.

Obviously, the singer is playing the role of the painted-face male (jing). Interestingly, Peking Opera is generally mostly improvised, excepting specific melodies that follow the singers. It can be heard between the sections where he sings.
