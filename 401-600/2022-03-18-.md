Microhouse is a stripped down, minimal form of House music, originating in the late 90s, which takes influence from Minimal Techno, Glitch and IDM. Although often built around a steady 4/4 time signature, it differs from traditional House music with regard to its use of samples: short clips of static, glitches and sometimes even human voices are often included, as opposed to House's common use of drum machine samples, such as hi-hats and kick drums. Here are a couple tracks from "Immunity" (released 2013) by Jon Hopkins:
