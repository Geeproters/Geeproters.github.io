Boogie, or Disco Boogie, is a continuation of the Disco sound with increased influence from Funk and R&B/Soul and a slower tempo, often featuring drum machines and synthesizers. The production of this genre went into decline in the late 80s, but the genre still maintains a massive cult following. Also, I've recced songs from the genre of City Pop before, but never really described it. City Pop was a wave of Japanese Pop intended to reflect urban life during the period of the country's booming economy in the 1970s and 1980s, featuring a contemporary Western sound and lush arrangements. 

City pop declined in 1990 with the rise of asset prices in Japan and Shibuya-kei (mentioned recently), which was more indie and DIY influenced but still based on the Japanese urban life, and which replaced its popularity. The genre then acquired a renowned interest later in the 2010s through strong internet coverage, as an underground revival surfaced with acts like idol group Especia and singer 一十三十一 [Hitomitoi] having major popularity. Anyway, this album Ride On Time from Tatsuro Yamashita is something of a mix of City Pop, Synth Funk, and Boogie.

Worth a listen if that's the type of music you're into. Like Koibito e to Shibuya-Kei, Ride On Time is a beloved album from the genre of City Pop and Japanese Boogie.
