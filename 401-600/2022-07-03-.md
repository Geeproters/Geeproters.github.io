언니네이발관 [Sister's Barbershop] was a South Korean Indie/Alt/Pop Rock band. Formed in 1996 and disbanded in 2017. 

Some of their music is also considered Sophisti-Pop, since it incorporates influences from Jazz, classic R&B and Soul with a slick, polished production style. Here’re a couple of their songs: 

An album of theirs from 1998:

Here's a song from their last release:

Sweet and soft sounding. Clean production.
