Brame, by Ruby my Dear.
 Ruby My Dear - Brame (full album)
https://youtu.be/vjq0vio0S7M 
This album is another fusion of breakcore, baroque music, and metal (i.e. similar to Igorrr and Venetian Snares, who I talked about previously). I'm not sure I have a good reason for liking this album as much as I do. Its not perfect, but to me its constantly impressive and surprising, taking exactly what I like about breakcore, IDM, metal, and chamber music, and mixing it all into one flavorful, polished package. Imo a must-listen for those interested in either breakcore or classicore, and one of my favorite albums from recent memory. 2018 Album.
