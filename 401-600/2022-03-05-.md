Since I've mentioned them (over a year ago), but never actually recced a song, here's something by Snarky Puppy.
 Snarky Puppy - Lingus (We Like It Here)
https://youtu.be/L_XJ_s5IsQc Snarky Puppy is an American instrumental ensemble led by bassist Michael League. The band combines a variety of jazz idioms, rock, world music, and funk and has won four Grammy Awards. Snarky Puppy is sometimes referred to as a "collective." The band's current roster boasts about 19 members, and well over 40 musicians have performed with the group over the years and through the group's 14 albums. As a result, their music is almost always very full sounding, and is generally quite complex, featuring a lot of improvisation. Much of their music can also be described as pop music without vocals.

can't believe I missed this Andy Morin thing
