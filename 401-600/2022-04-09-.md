Cy8er (see previous) and PSYQUI (rec 239) are two of the better-known Kawaii Future Bass creators. kamone sano is another, and I just wanted to briefly mention her, as her music combines my favorite elements of future bass, as well as breakcore (sometimes sparsely, other times overtly). Her music also falls into Bitpop, Wonky, and Brostep. I've described those first two already, but not Brostep. That is, Brostep is an offshoot of Dubstep which replaces its sub-bass-oriented sound with an emphasis on catchy or aggressive mid-range melodies. Here's one of her less excited songs (still quite energizing). More future bass than breakcore, but you can still here some of it in there (0:54)

Here's one of her more excited tracks. Again, it doesn't go excessive with the breakbeats. Just sprinkling them in here and there (0:30, 0:48, 1:17), which keeps it super fresh. Notably they are generally more "breakcore-esque" breaks than "breakbeat" type ones.
