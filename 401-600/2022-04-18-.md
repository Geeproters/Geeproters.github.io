Moving to Central Africa, From RYM: Soukous is a popular style of guitar-led Congolese dance music blending rhythms from Cuban Music with the traditional music of the Congo area. The style is typically defined by bright, intricate guitar lines and improvisations, often played high on the fretboard. Various ensemble sizes may be used, with upwards of three guitars sometimes employed simultaneously. Prominent horn and vocal arrangements are occasionally incorporated as well. Lyrics are often sung across ethnic boundaries, making them accessible to both French and Lingala-speaking listeners. Originally emerging from a style known as "Congolese rumba", the name soukous (originating from the French word secouer, meaning "to shake") was introduced in the late 1960s as some Congolese artists began emphasizing faster dance tempos and virtuosic guitar improvisation. Here's one such Soukous track from Congolese supergroup Kékélé's 2006 album Kinavana.

It also falls into the categories of Son Cubano and Guajira, which I might talk about later.
