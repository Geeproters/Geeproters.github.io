Here's the last drone album for a while. Daughter of Darkness by Natural Snow Buildings. Another dark ambient one, but this also falls into the genres of Free Folk, Ritual Ambient, Noise, Avant-Folk, Neo-Medieval Folk, Tribal Ambient. There are a number of esoteric genres there. To give them description: -Ritual Ambient is a subgenre of Dark Ambient that creates a dark, deep, disturbing, ritualistic and occult-like atmosphere. It often features some chanting voices, tribal rhythms, and appropriate 

-Free folk refers to a form of Psychedelic Folk originating in the 1970s. Psychedelic, often unstructured, making frequent use of repetition, improvisation, and long songs. Free folk was notably influenced by other genres, including American Primitivism, Drone, and Free Improvisation. 

-Tribal ambient combines the theory and atmosphere of Ambient with traditional instruments and sounds from around the globe. 
In other words, the album is ritualistic, hypnotic, and spiritual, as well as dark, noisy, and repetitive. 7 HOURS!!

These types of albums can be just as or more immersive than any other kind of music, but you really need to be in the right mood or else you'll just get bored
