Vols. 11 & 12 is the sixth compilation album by the desert rock supergroup Desert Sessions, a side project of Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme. The album came out in 2019, after a 16 year hiatus from Vols. 9 & 10. 8 Tracks for a total of 30 minutes. Each one worth listening to imo, but here are my favorites.
