Muito Kaballa Power Ensemble is a German 9-piece group that started out as a one-man show on the streets and quickly gained attention through the head's, Niklas MÃ¼ndemann's, loopstation performances. 

Here's a 2021 album from the group, Mamari. It primarily incorporates elements of Afrobeat and Jazz-Funk, as well as Rumba Cubana.
