Neoclassical darkwave is a genre combining dark and melancholic atmosphere with Western Classical Music. It was pioneered by Dead Can Dance and Black Tape for a Blue Girl, Darkwave-related bands who mixed elements of Dark Ambient with classical music inspired sounds and ethereal vocals. Many of the tracks from the OST of the horror anime Shiki can be described with this genre. Overall, a super atmospheric soundtrack with some really interesting and appropriate instrumentation. Often ominous, beautiful, or both. I haven't seen the show, but I've listened over the full soundtrack a couple times now.

My favorite tracks are: 
(0:00) Day and Night - relaxing, nice female vocals 
(3:04) Eau de Vie - not particularly interesting but I like the orchestration mixed with the voices and electronic percussion 
(19:50) Muddy Water - maybe the most interesting track on here. Synthy/hip-hoppy/throat singy 
(24:38) Dance of Death - slightly off-putting in a fairly relaxing way 
(27:34) Silent Night - ominous and suspenseful 
(53:57) Untitled - just because I like the instrumentation 
(1:05:08) Requiem - very pleasant, male and female vocals 
(1:08:02) Memento Mori - just because I like the prominent throat singing
