Mande music encompasses the diverse forms of the Mande peoples, a group of West African ethnic groups who speak any of the Mande languages. Some of the largest Mande ethnic groups are the Mandinka, the Maninka, the Bambara, and the Soninke. Mande society is traditionally caste-based, with the musician caste known variously among Mande groups as jeli or jali. Their role was to act as historians, storytellers, advisors, and arbitrators, and to preserve Mande history and traditions through their music. The main instruments associated with jeli are the kora, a 21-string harp, the balafon, a wooden xylophone, and the n'goni, a small lute. Djeli Moussa Diawara is known internationally for his kora playing (you can see the instrument on the cover). Here's his album Yasimika released 1983. Each of the three previously mentioned instruments, along with voice, are present.

The balafon is a idiophone that makes use of gourds for reverberation, heard quite clearly at 0:20
