Emray - Kya~ncer (Full Album)
https://youtu.be/rOQClxYt3_I?t=888
It's a breakcore album, this timestamped track isn't really breakcore though. More of a jazzy, pop-rocky, glitchy kawaiicore track, its pretty much just a remix of S≈çtaisei Riron - Classroom Collapse. The rest of the album is pretty good too. Disorienting and chaotic, as you generally want breakcore to be. I'm partial to track 7. "GONNA FRAG YOUR SANITY", and track 8. "GONNA FRAG YOUR SOUL".
