Mallsoft is a subgenre of Vaporwave that first appeared in 2012 that blends the main characteristics of the genre with what can be described as background/elevator music. Mallsoft typically samples music commonly played in malls and other shopping centers, such as Easy Listening, Smooth Jazz or other forms of background or elevator music associated with Muzak, and it sometimes mixes in some elements from Ambient. Mallsoft artists often apply to said mall muzak a heavy use of reverb in addition to other editing practices commonly found in vaporwave. Mallsoft reached the height of its popularity in 2016, and has more or less plateaued since that point. Here are 3 releases belonging to the genre. 

Virtual Dream Plaza (Almost 17 hours total. This ones closer to regular ambient, but still with Mallsoft elements)
