I've used the term previously, but for a more detailed description, "New-age is a genre of music intended to create artistic inspiration, relaxation, and optimism. It is used by listeners for yoga, massage, meditation, and reading as a method of stress management to bring about a state of ecstasy rather than trance, or to create a peaceful atmosphere in their home or other environments, associated with environmentalism and New Age spirituality." Here's a Korean new-age artist I've been listening to recently while studying, TTRM. 3 Hour Mix:
 과거와 현재, 그리고 미래의 꿈 / 3시간/ 몽환적인 뉴에이지 자작곡들 모음
