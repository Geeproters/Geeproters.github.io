Since the inception of these dailies, I've severely neglected various genres of South Korean music for no real reason. Instead, I usually focus on Soundtrack music, Japanese Pop, World Folk Music, and Experimental or electronic music. I've done at least 60 Japanese recs, and only around 5 Korean ones including yesterday's. With that said, for the next few recs, I'll be talking about some great Korean music I've listened to recently or in the past. 
Starting with: 
 동요 / 할시온의 관, a two-track single by 그림자 공동체 [Shadow Community]. Released 2019.

It runs for less than 9 minutes, so it’s an easy listen. I’d give it at least 3 minutes before making a judgment. This artist, 그림자 공동체 [Shadow Community], is actually the same person as 공중도둑 Mid-Air Thief from yesterday. This is a side project of theirs, involving a different vocalist. This single falls into the genres of Psychedelic Folk, Neo-Psychedelia, Ambient Pop, Dream Pop, Psychedelic Pop, and Folktronica.

Shadow Community also made one of my favorite slowcore albums, 거울의 숲, from 2016. I'll talk about that genre later
