Much of ARIA The ANIMATION's Original Soundtrack is done by Choro Club. A Japanese acoustic trio consisting of mandolin, guitar, and double bass, who I first mentioned on rec 296. Like their other music, consistently great. They've composed a ton of music for Aria, but its easiest to find in high quality on Spotify.
