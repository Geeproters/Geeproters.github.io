The new Polyphia single is pretty good
 Polyphia - Playing God (Official Music Video)

Since that's math rock, here's another math rock / alt metal / djent band I haven't mentioned yet, Unprocessed. This particular song isn't very "mathy" though.
 Unprocessed - deadrose (Official Music Video)

Also here's something from only their lead guitarist that I like more than that previous song.
 Manuel Gardner Fernandes - Clown
