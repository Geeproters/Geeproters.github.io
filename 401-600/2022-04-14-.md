From AllMusic: "aYia are an alternative pop trio known for their singles "Ruins" and "Sparkle." Led by singer/songwriter and poet Ásta Fanney Sigurðardóttir ... Crafting alluring and atmospheric soundscapes with euphoric synths, angelic vocals, and pulsating electro beats, the group gained attention after putting out their debut single "Water Plant" on Bedroom Community in 2016" Not a particularly interesting rec, I just like this song.

Here's another electropop band, Chaos Chaos. Not really related, but I used to listen to them a lot so I might as well put it here.
