Since its vaguely related to the previous rec, Bardcore or Tavernwave is a musical microgenre that became popular in 2020, consisting of medieval-inspired remakes of popular songs. Hildegard von Blingin' is likely the best-known composer/arranger/musician to work in this genre. It's funny so naturally I would talk about this music at some point sooner or later.

(reply to rec 176) I mentioned the soundtrack this song comes from 9 months ago, so I won't do a new rec for it, but here's a great cover of a classic anime op. They nailed the section starting at 2:48. Its also nice to hear a slightly stripped-down version of the piece, which maybe helps to make it feel more personal.
