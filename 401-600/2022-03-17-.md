Deep house is a genre of House music that grew out of Chicago House during the mid-1980s. Pioneered by Larry Heard and Marshall Jefferson, the genre is characterized by a relaxed tempo of around 110-125 BPM, soft pads, and muted basslines, and often features samples from Soul, Jazz, and Funk. Here are a couple tracks from "2012 - 2017" (released 2018) by Against All Logic:
 Against All Logic  - This Old House Is All I Have

 Against All Logic - Now U Got Me Hooked
