Dance Maniax is a series of rhythm games developed by Konami for Arcade platforms. The series is considered part of the BEMANI. The development of the Dance Maniax series has been discontinued. Here's one catchy song from the DanceManiaX Original Soundtrack from 2001. It was reused for various Beatmania IIDX games.

It's got a eurodance mixed with bossa nova feel, with french lyrics and subdued vocals. 

Here's another from that band, this ones from beatmaniaIIDX 11 IIDX RED:
