Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra was a Canadian post-rock band that formed in 1999, originating from Montreal, Quebec. Their album "He Has Left Us Alone But Shafts Of Light Sometimes Grace The Corner Of Our Rooms..." (2000) had a few hits. One of which was this track, "13 Angels Standing Guard 'Round The Side Of Your Bed," now with over 6 million listens on Spotify.
