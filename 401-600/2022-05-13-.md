It's only been a couple of weeks since the last Kayōkyoku recommendation, but this album is so warm and summery that I can't neglect mentioning it for our current weather. Sunshower by Taeko Ohnuki:

Again, Kayōkyoku describes Japanese popular music prominent during the later period of the Shōwa era of the early 1950s to late 1980s. There's a nice Jazz-Funk vibe on a lot of these tracks, but the album also falls into the genre of "New Music." "New Music" rose and fell in popularity in Japan over the 1970s. As a genre it combined elements of Contemporary Folk with Kayōkyoku songwriting and light Pop Rock elements. It was a fairly short movement itself, but it had a lasting influence as groups and artists would later incorporate similar elements of Funk and Disco with Pop Rock elements to create a more upbeat and urban style that would come to be known as City Pop, which of course grew very popular in the 1980s (see rec 502).
