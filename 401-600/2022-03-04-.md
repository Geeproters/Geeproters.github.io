its all over once you admit to listening to an artist called "Loli in early 20s" who makes music in a genre called "lolicore".
 [Lolicore] Loli in early 20s - Da Da Is Tape To And U U U
https://youtu.be/3xzlURURGEM My search for good breakcore has taken me too far.

Edit: they changed their name, thankfully.

Most of that person's other stuff is more degenerate ^ I actually like that one quite a bit Since I'm in the breakcore realm anyway here are a couple more breakcore songs, but these ones are by TOKYOPILL
 TOKYOPILL - NUMB
