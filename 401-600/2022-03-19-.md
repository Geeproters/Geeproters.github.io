Outsider house is a form of House characterized by its intentional use of rough, lo-fi production, often utilizing a mix of analogue/analogue-like and digital instrumentation. Born in the early 2010s, outsider house has been analyzed as a genre standing in opposition to other 2010s commercialization trends of house music, avoiding the polished production and mixing that have caught on in the mainstream. Though it has mostly been inspired by the soulful, laid-back styles of 1990s and 2000s Deep House, outsider house often re-contextualizes and borrows inspiration from many Electronic Dance Music outside its sphere, including various 1990s Techno genres and other house genres like Ambient House. And here are a couple tracks from "Makin' Magick" (released 2017) by DJ Sabrina the Teenage DJ
