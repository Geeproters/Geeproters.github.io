This album gets in my youtube recommendations a lot. "Oncle Jazz" from Montreal band "Men I Trust" with Dragos Chiriac (keyboards, mastering), Jessy Caron (guitar, bass, keyboards), and Emmanuelle Proulx (vocals)

https://youtu.be/iVg30U6O764 It's good. It could be called "Sophisti-Pop", a retrospective term for a style of Pop music that incorporates influences from Jazz, classic R&B and Soul along with a slick, polished production style. This album in particular has an ethereal, dream pop or psychedelic pop feel, with clear elements of synth funk. Lush, mellow, and maybe a bit lethargic or sensual
really nice basslines in particular
