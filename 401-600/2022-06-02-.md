Here's something else by Steve Reich, "Music for 18 Musicians." It is a work of minimalist music composed by Steve Reich during 1974â€“1976. Its world premiere was on April 24, 1976, at The Town Hall in New York City. Following this, a recording of the piece was released by ECM New Series in 1978. It's full length runs from around 56:31 to just over an hour.

One thing you might notice (particularly in the version with video) is the marimba(s), playing on the off-beat for almost the entire hour. That's gotta be a challenge. to see what I mean by playing on the off-beat, it's this, the second Marimba from the left.

That guy in particular almost never stops that beat, which you can see by skipping around (press any number on your keyboard, and you can hear it, and usually see it in less than a minute)
