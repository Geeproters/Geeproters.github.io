멀고먼-길 [Long Way] is a 1974 album by 한대수 [Hahn Dae-soo], belonging to the genres of Singer-Songwriter, Contemporary Folk, Folk Rock. The first song off the album could be considered Freak Folk. I'll describe that genre in detail at a later date.  Han Dae-soo (Hangul: 한대수; born March 12, 1948) is a South Korean folk rock singer-songwriter. He is considered South Korea's "master of folk rock" and a pioneer of 1960s Korean hippie culture. 

Here are two songs from the album:

The album is passionate, sentimental, and raw. You can feel a lot of the love that was put into making it.
