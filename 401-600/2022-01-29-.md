Surfacing in the early 2010s, Neurohop combines the swung, mid-tempo breakbeats of Glitch Hop [EDM] with the complex, energetic basslines of Neurofunk. The genre is heavily built around frenetic rhythms and mechanical sound design, while maintaining relaxed Hip Hop tempos of approximately 80-120 BPM, as well as sampling of Funk and Jazz.
