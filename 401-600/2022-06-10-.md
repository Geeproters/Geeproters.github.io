Emerging in the SoundCloud underground rap scene in the late 2010s, hexd is a musical approach and a form of Electronic music characterized by heavily bit-crushed, sometimes sped-up and pitched-up vocals (particularly in the case of remixed material), and highly compressed and distorted production, typically made from existing material of genres such as Trap, Cloud Rap, Emo Rap on one hand and Trance, Breakbeat and other Electronic Dance Music styles on the other. With additional sound effects like delay and heavy reverberation, the genre aims to encapsulate a dreamy, murky, surreal atmosphere, sometimes used to create a sense of nostalgia, though many artists may instead focus on futuristic, near-mechanic ambiance. The genre is occasionally influenced by the hyper-real, mystical, and self-satirizing sound and aesthetic associated with Vaporwave and other genres in the bigger Vapor movement, with certain producers borrowing elements of the sample manipulation and processing typical of these genres. Obviously, this genre takes influence from a lot of places, as such, I'll enter these two 2020 albums from two arguable "opposite" ends of the Hexd spectrum in terms of musicality: 

bliss3three -C3L3STIAL天の, which takes mostly from Vaporwave, and also from Hypnagogic Pop and Broken Transmission.

Anthony1, Sienna Sleep, and Exodia - Ateriavia, which takes mostly from Trance and belongs to Trance subgenres like Uplifting Trance, Freetekno, Hard Trance. It's also a well-liked modern Freeform Hardcore album, a genre that emerged in the mid-1990s, combining fast and hard-hitting rhythms with heavy influence from the synthesizers of Trance.
