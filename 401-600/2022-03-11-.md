"mouse on the keys" is a Japanese post-rock, math-rock, jazz-fusion band from Tokyo. Usually its Akira Kawasaki on drums, and both Atsushi Kiyota and Daisuke Niitome on keyboards. They've created their own style that's somewhat hard to categorize as either jazz or rock, but does lie somewhere within or adjacent to that spectrum. Very textural and rhythmically focused, but also pretty abstract. Here's my favorite album from them "An Anxious Object" from 2009 (my favorite track happens to be "Double Bind", which starts at 19:08).
