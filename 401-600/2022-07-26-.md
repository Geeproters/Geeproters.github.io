Rock in Opposition

Rock in Opposition or RIO was a movement representing a collective of progressive bands in the late 1970s united in their opposition to the music industry that refused to recognise their music. It was initiated by English avant-rock group Henry Cow in March 1978 when they invited four mainland European groups (Stormy Six, Samla Mammas Manna, Univers Zéro, Etron fou leloublan) to come to London and perform in a festival called "Rock in Opposition".

This music is characterized by great complexity in writing and an avant-garde take on contemporary classical music, the most modern jazz or urban music. The movement is far less active now compared to the late 70s to early 80s.

Måltid is a 1973 album from one of those 4 bands mentioned, Samla Mammas Manna. It also belongs to the genres of Avant-Prog, Jazz Fusion, Zolo, and Jazz-Rock, along with RIO.

A pretty fun listen. Creative, musically complex, and technically impressive.
