Jennifer Vashti Bunyan (born 1945) is an English singer-songwriter. At age 18, Bunyan traveled to New York and discovered the music of Bob Dylan through his The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan album and decided to become a full-time musician. She released her debut album, Just Another Diamond Day, in 1970. The album sold very few copies and Bunyan, discouraged, abandoned her musical career. By 2000, her album had acquired a cult following; it was re-released and Bunyan recorded more songs, initiating the second phase of her musical career after a gap of thirty years. She subsequently released two albums: Lookaftering in 2005, and Heartleap in 2014.

She now receives more than 400000 monthly listeners on spotify, and her two most-listened tracks are both at over 15 million listens. More recently, Bunyan's music has been associated with the cottagecore (also farmcore and countrycore) aesthetic of the 2010s.

Here're two tracks from that 1970 album:
 I'd Like To Walk Around In Your Mind

Her music is serene and pastoral. The songs are simple in both their lyrics and construction. Its her unique, whispery vocal style that brings me back to her music and places her among my favorite contemporary folk / folk pop artists (some others being Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan, Judee Sill, Andrew Bird).
