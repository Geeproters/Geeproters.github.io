In the same vein of easy-to-listen music, here are a couple tracks from Domenique Dumont, who I talked about around a month ago.

 Domenique Dumont - Sans Cesse, Mon Cheri

The album falls into the genre of Balearic beat, that is, House music characterized by its relaxed atmosphere, laid back feel and R&B influenced swingy percussion, and slow and heavy pulses at 90-110 bpm. Balearic beat doesn't have a very specific sound as it blends and borrows sounds from a wide range of genres including African Music, Hispanic American Music, Italo-Disco, Soul, Funk and Dub.  Also, Sophisti-Pop, Exotica, Dream Pop, Chillwave, and Minimal Wave

 Close Enough - The Tiny
