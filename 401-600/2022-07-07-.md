Gut (굿, also Romanized kut or goot) are the rites performed by Korean shamans, involving offerings and sacrifices to gods, spirits and ancestors. They are characterized by rhythmic movements, songs, oracles and prayers. These rites are meant to create welfare, promoting commitment between the spirits and humankind.

Muak (무악(巫樂)), or Musok Eumak (무속 음악(巫俗音樂)), is the traditional Korean shamanistic music performed at and during a shamanistic ritual, the Gut. It consists of singing, dancing and percussion music.  

Sinawi is an improvisational genre of Korean Folk Music that originated in the southwestern regions of South Korea. It serves as a musical accompaniment to some of these rituals. It is performed in small ensembles, traditionally composed of haegeum and daegeum flutes, and janggu and buk drums. In more recent times, the instrumentation has expanded to Korean stringed instruments such as gayageum and geomungo. 

The Shamans of the Eastern Seaboard by the Kim Suk Chul Ensemble and 무악 동해무속사물 by 김석출 [Kim Seok-chul] are two albums belonging to the genre, released 2005 and 1994, respectively.

Here's an article on Korean shamanism. It's an interesting read.

I try to keep a fairly open mind when it comes to new genres and albums but man. That first one is almost unlistenable.
