Here's another project from DJ Rozwell, interesting enough to warrant its own rec. "NONE OF THIS IS REAL", the "roguelike" album. The album is a plunderphonics/hip hop/dungeon synth exploration that you are instructed to listen to on shuffle with a crossfade between tracks. doing this results in a continuous, roguelike-esque experience, "a new quest every time you listen". There are also at least 9 "expansion pack" albums, to be dropped into a playlist with the original NONE OF THIS IS REAL, and you can expand the range of places and sounds to discover. Some are made by DJ Roswell himself, others are fanmade. The most complete list I could find is here:
