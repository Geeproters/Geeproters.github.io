Hildegard of Bingen (born 1098), also known as Saint Hildegard and the Sibyl of the Rhine, was a German Benedictine abbess and polymath active as a writer, composer, philosopher, mystic, visionary, and as a medical writer and practitioner during the High Middle Ages. Canticles of Ecstasy is an album of sacred vocal music written by this abbess. It is considered by some to be of the purest and most perfect compositions of Gregorian chant ever written. This is a 1994 recording of the album by the ensemble Sequentia.

For those new to the term, Gregorian Chant refers to liturgical, monophonic chants that accompanied Mass and other rituals in Western Christianity. They are the most common and important type of plainsong. Plainsong, referring to those sacred pieces that are composed in Latin, was the exclusive form of Christian church music until the ninth century, and the introduction of polyphony.
Of Christian Liturgical Music, while Gregorian Chant is not my favorite, this album in particular is one that I am quite fond of.   It is ethereal and hypnotic, serene even, and I can't help but imagine the feelings of rapture and gratefulness for life this music might have conjured during the High Middle Ages.
