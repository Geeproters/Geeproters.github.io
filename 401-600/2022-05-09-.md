Birdsong describes recordings of bird vocalizations often distinguished into the shorter bird call and longer, more complex birdsong. Obviously. "Birdsong" as a musical genre will generally go 1 of 2 ways. The first can be heard with "Wild Birds, living in Japan" (1995) by Tsuruhiko Kabaya. Pure field recordings with minimal electroacoustic manipulation. Another form of the "Animal Sounds" genre talked about in rec 471. Basically just unadulterated birdsong.

The other, perhaps more interesting direction "Birdsong" as a musical genre will often go can be heard with "Lovregana: Music From a Tasmanian Forest" (1990) by Ron Nagorcka. This album uses electroacoustic manipulation on field recordings of birds.
