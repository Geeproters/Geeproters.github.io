Sweet ANN, originally codenamed "JODIE", is an English VOCALOID developed and distributed by PowerFX Systems AB., and was released in June 2007 for the VOCALOID2 engine. Her voicebank was originally developed for the the first VOCALOID engine before being ported. She is voiced by an Australian singer whose artist name is "Jody". Other than a name, her voice provider's identity has not been revealed.

My favorite usages of Sweet Ann's voice were for the Nichijou OST. These three tracks in particular, that played during certain segments of the show:
 Nichijou OST - Helvetica Standard ~sono 1~
