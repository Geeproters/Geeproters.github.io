Here's an interesting multicultural performance, rooted in Syrian, Persian and Sufi music cultures, applying various rhythmical and timbral elements throughout the process. Led primarily by two performers: Mehdi Aminian had a musical inception in Persian Music and Ney (in this performance he also does Setar and Vocals) going back to his adolescence which he spent in Iran. His fascination with Sufi literature and poetry as well as the various musical projects he had while living in Europe and South East Asia, inspired Mehdi to shape a unique style of his own in his music and compositions, rising above the confinements of one particular genre. Mohamad Zatari is an Aleppian (of the Syrian city of Aleppo) composer and Oud performer. His artistic endeavor is to break stereotypes, to blend various musical genres and styles, and to search constantly for new musical paths of inspiration. There's also Behnam Masoumi on Tombak & Percussion, and Leila Soldevila on the Double Bass.
