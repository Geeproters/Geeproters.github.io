More in that drone music vein. Virgins by Tim Hecker (2013) is an Ambient, Drone, Electroacoustic, Glitch, Noise, Post-Minimalism, and Dark Ambient album. This one is denser, darker, and noisier than the previous one. A bit surreal and ominous, and reminiscent of a beautiful and intricate yet minimal kind of slow-burn horror.
