New Jack swing is a genre of music that generally mixes light Hip Hop & Funk production techniques with Contemporary R&B vocals and melodies. It was mainly popular in the late 1980s and 1990s, alongside pure Hip Hop and R&B. Public Announcement, R. Kelly, Bobby Brown, Michael Jackson, and Prince were some of the more popular musicians associated with the genre. This genre was engineered to ride off the popularity of Hip Hop and R&B at the time, so it's not the type of music I would typically talk about. I'm making the exception because of how well-defined the genre is from a temporal standpoint, and because among western pop subgenres, its one of my favorites. Here're 3 of my favorite New Jack swing songs.

 Piece Of My Love
