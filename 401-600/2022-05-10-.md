The kashaka is a percussion instrument consisting of two small gourds, often filled with beans - essentially two small maracas connected by a string. Usually, one gourd is held in the hand and the other is quickly swung from side to side around the hand, creating a "clack" sound upon impact. It originated in West Africa, but has been reproduced in various countries under different names: Patica (Japan), Kosika (USA). Other names include Asalato, Kes Kes, Tchangot Tche, Koshkah, and many others. Stevie Wonder cover with a simple kashaka part:
