Nueva trova. 
The nueva trova movement is the Cuban offshoot of the bigger and widespread Nueva canción latinoamericana movement, appearing during the second half of the 1960s and early 1970s. Just as Nueva canción was associated with the popularity of social movements in Latin America and pretended to renew Folk traditions within the region, nueva trova found inspiration in the 1950s Cuban Revolution and had the intention of introducing new musical ideas to the original Trova, which serves as the main root of the genre. As such, nueva trova is noted for the use of politically-charged lyrical content and the influence of other popular music styles such as Rock, Pop and other Contemporary Folk currents. 

I'm actually more partial to the old trova style, and so here are some works by an artist belonging to both genres, Carlos Puebla: 
Y en Eso Llego Fidel, released 1976
