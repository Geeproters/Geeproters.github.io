Karolina Rec AKA Resina is a Polish Modern Classical, Ambient, Electroacoustic, and Post-Minimalism composer. Some of her work should be classified as Drone or Dark Ambient. Her music primarily incorporates string instruments, often along with voice or percussion, as well as more experimental effects. There's quite a bit of crossover between the techniques she uses and those used to score horror movie soundtracks. Here're a couple tracks from her I like:
 PREMIERE: Resina - Failed Myth Simulation [130701]

 Night Time
