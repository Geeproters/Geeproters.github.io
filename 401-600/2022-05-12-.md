Here's another rec from the AKIRA OST. Parts of this track belong to the genre of "Shōmyō", a style of Japanese Buddhist chant that utilizes the yō scale. Used primarily in the Tendai and Shingon sects, shōmyō originated from Indian Vedic chants which were then adapted by the Chinese during the mid-8th century and brought over by returning Japanese monks. Patterns used in the chant involve melodies sung using each breath and are woven strategically around the "open spaces" within the melodies, often causing intense and technical performances.
