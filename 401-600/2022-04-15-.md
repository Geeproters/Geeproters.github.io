Italo House originated in Italy during the late 1980s, making use of anthemic pianos, diva vocals, and Dance-Pop song structures. Deep House emerged in the United States during the mid-1980s, featuring a relaxed tempo and influences from Jazz, Funk, and Soul. In some ways, the genre is similar to Ambient House Music. Here's a single falling into both those genres, I Can Feel It / Audio Trip by Dreamatic, released in 1991.
