Ambient house was a mostly British development in the beginning of the 1990s, bringing together House beats with "chilled out" or soothing atmospheres inspired by Ambient. The genre became popular with ravers coming down from drug-induced highs and provided an important stepping stone for similarly relaxed electronic styles, including Ambient Techno, Ambient Dub, and Psybient. Early 1990s works by The Orb and The KLF defined the genre and took it into the UK charts.

Here's a nice, underrated Ambient House / Downtempo / Chillwave from Acetantina. Dead Internet, released 2018.
