The hurdy-gurdy is a string instrument that produces sound by a hand-crank-turned, rosined wheel rubbing against the strings. The wheel functions much like a violin bow, and single notes played on the instrument sound similar to those of a violin. Guilhem Desq is a musician who has innovated the sound of the old-world instrument by electrifying it. Here are a couple tracks from his album Visions:
 Guilhem Desq - Cicatrices - Hurdy Gurdy

 Guilhem Desq - Le château magique (Hurdy Gurdy)

The hurdy-gurdy is generally thought to have originated from fiddles in either Europe or the Middle East (e.g., the rebab instrument) some time before the eleventh century A.D. The first recorded reference to fiddles in Europe was in the 9th century by the Persian geographer Ibn Khurradadhbih (d. 911).
