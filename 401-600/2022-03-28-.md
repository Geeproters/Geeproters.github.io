A Quiet Farwell, 2016â€“2018 is a 2019 album from Slauson Malone. Sound Collage / Plunderphonics, Experimental Hip Hop, Glitch Hop. Where it shines brightest are the places it chooses to be more abstract. A more-or-less boundary-pushing album. Elements of hypnagogic pop, ambient, cloud rap, and more. If this album was a literary genre it might be "Psychological". I timestamped my personal favorite, but the whole album is worth a listen.
