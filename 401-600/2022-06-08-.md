Here's another Thom Yorke Project, the last one I talked about being the supergroup Atoms for Peace (rec 480) The Smile are an English rock band comprised of Radiohead members Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood with Sons of Kemet drummer Tom Skinner. I mentioned Sons of Kemet all the way back on rec 11 almost a year and a half ago. 

They are produced by Nigel Godrich, Radiohead's longtime producer. They incorporate elements of post-punk, progressive rock, Afrobeat and electronic music into their stuff.
