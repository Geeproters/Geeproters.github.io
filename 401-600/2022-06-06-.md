"Yeyo" is a Boom Bap, Hardcore Hip Hop album from Venezualan rapper Lil Supa (aka Marlon Luis Morales Santana [birth name], Fresco, Lou Fresco, Lil Supa', Lil Supá, Little Supa, Little Supa', Supa, Tzu, Zoo, NEØN, and Marc Ginale). It was released February 2022. "Hardcore Hip Hop" is characterized by confrontation and aggression, whether in the lyricism, vocal delivery, hard beats, heavy production, or any combination thereof. As described previously (rec 505), Boom-Bap is a production style identified by an acoustic-sounding drum pattern of a kick drum on the downbeat followed by a cracking snare on the upbeat.

The standout feature of this album is Supa's punctuated, emphatic rapping style. It's also always interesting to hear hip hop music from countries besides the U.S. The beats are nice and grimy too. Spanish is a good language for rap.
