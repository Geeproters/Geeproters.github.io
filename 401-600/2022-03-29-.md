"EAI (Electroacoustic Improvisation) is a difficult to define style of Free Improvisation characterized by a very slow moving, physical, textured aesthetic, often created using unconventional instruments (like prepared guitars and turntables) processed through a laptop computer. It takes influence from a wide range of improvised music - such as Noise, Drone and experimental Jazz. The sheer uniqueness of the genre makes it difficult to precisely pin down its development, but it does maintain a keen following." 
Here are some tracks that fall into the genre.
