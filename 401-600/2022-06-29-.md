Sea Pearl is a Korean YouTube music compiler. Their playlists (or mixes) consist mostly of Korean, Japanese, and American music, mostly running from ~15-25 minutes. As of writing, they also have three 1-hour playlists. 9 of their mixes (mostly instrumental ones) have 1,000,000+ views. These types of channels are pretty easy to find, and are an easy and accessible way to find new music. Here are two of my favorite Sea Pearl playlists: 
청춘 [youth] consisting of soft Korean indie rock

낭만 [romance] consisting of beautiful and bubbly Japanese instrumental pieces.

You can tell how well put together these mixes are by listening to the first two tracks from that second one in sequence. The instrumentation and musical structure on both these distinct songs tie perfectly well into each other. It's actually shocking how well it works.
