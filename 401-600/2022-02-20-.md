Detroit Techno can be seen as the original style of Techno, with artists like Juan Atkins, Derrick May and Kevin Saunderson (collectively known as The Belleville Three, as they all went to the city’s Belleville High School) helping to cement the genre as a local underground phenomenon during the mid-1980s. Influenced heavily by the work of Electronic acts like Kraftwerk, as well as the Electro and Chicago House prevalent at the time, they forged a signature mechanical, detached sound, one that echoes the atmosphere of the city’s nightlife. The genre is typically driven by the distinctive sound of the Roland TR-909 drum machine, a piece of equipment that still remains in use today, allowing Detroit Techno to sound simultaneously “otherworldly” and funky, comparable to Detroit's rich history of Rhythm & Blues, Soul and Funk. Here are a few tracks from various Detroit Techno albums:

"Although techno is widely associated with Europe, the music was invented in Detroit and its suburbs in the early 1980s by young African-Americans armed with drum machines, futurist ideals and a predilection for Kraftwerk." -npr
