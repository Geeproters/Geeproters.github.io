Dyens wrote modern compositions with complex rhythms and challenging techniques, but he also adapted music from different genres for the classical guitar. In this case he arranged twenty-six well-known chansons for the instrument. He combines melody and accompaniment all the while maintaining the original mood of the song. The relaxed atmosphere of the music may seem simple, but these songs are surely deeply complex.
