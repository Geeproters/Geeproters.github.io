From the video description: "Presenting Intro to Dreamcore Mix, a selection by theuppermostinlife. This mix seeks to curate a sound deriving from Breakcore, Atmo/Int. DnB, and Jungle. Distinguishing traits being its use of vocals to help create a dreamy, melancholy, and nostalgic sound. With Breakcore being at times overwhelming from a subjective standpoint, Dreamcore seeks to find a balance between it's quick drums and soulful atmosphere to create something special." 

The choice of name is maybe a little confusing, as "dreamcore" shares its name with the popular aesthetic of dreamcore, which, also confusingly, is often associated with weirdcore music. Even more confusingly, the "weirdcore music" (recs 152-154) associated with the dreamcore aesthetic is usually but not always related to the weirdcore aesthetic (which itself has many branch aesthetics). Instead, this version of "dreamcore music" is just breakcore with a dreamlike quality, or liquid/dreamy DNB.
