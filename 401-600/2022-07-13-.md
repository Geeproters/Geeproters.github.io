The uilleann pipes are the characteristic national bagpipe of Ireland. Earlier known in English as "union pipes", their current name is a partial translation of the Irish language terms píobaí uilleann (literally, "pipes of the elbow"), from their method of inflation. There is no historical record of the name or use of the term uilleann pipes before the 20th century. It was an invention of Grattan Flood and the name stuck. People mistook the term 'union' to refer to the 1800 Act of Union; this is incorrect as Breandán Breathnach points out that a poem published in 1796 uses the term 'union'. Unlike the well-known Great Highland bagpipe (Scottish Gaelic: a' phìob mhòr), a type of bagpipe native to Scotland, uilleann pipes arent played with a mouthpiece or breath, only the elbows. Here's a video featuring some solo performances/demonstrations using the instrument, as well as some technical description, culture and history.
