草木萌動 (Sōmoku hōdō) is a Nu Jazz, Glitch Pop, Breakcore EP from 長谷川白紙 [Hakushi Hasegawa], who was 20 at the time of release. The album is also influenced by the genres of IDM, Art Pop, Jazz Fusion, Indietronica. This is an EP of old-school Japanese jazz-pop/New Music melodies sung over breakcore beats. It's a bit mind-blowing. One of my favorite Vocal Breakcore EPs for sure. I'd give it till the end of the second track (7:20) before deciding whether it's for you or not. On RYM, it's ranked #2 for 2018, #197 overall.

Chaotic, Complex, Dense and Playful
