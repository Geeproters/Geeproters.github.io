I've already talked about future bass a bit. Basically, its a mixture of some elements of dubstep and trap (particularly the drops) but with a warm bounce instead of lumbering whomps. I've also mentioned "lolicore" or other "loli" subgenres in the past where producers take samples of those types of characters and put them in their music. I’m not wholly sure of why producers work in this genre, but it can be pretty offputting, hopefully intentionally. Japan also spawned various "kawaii" subgenres (sometimes microgenres) of pre-existing music. Obviously, "kawaii future bass" is just a "cute" style of Future Bass rooted in anime and video game culture. It is a fairly new genre, having emerged in Japan in the mid-2010s. Here's a track falling into that category of "Kawaii Future Bass".

It is a great drop, no doubt
