Benjamin Sainte-Clémentine is a British poet, vocalist, composer, musician and actor. Clementine's debut album At Least for Now won the 2015 Mercury Prize. In February 2019 he was named a knight of the Order of Arts and Letters by the French government, in recognition of his contribution to the arts.   Impressive achievements, especially given his young age; he's now 33.  His music is best described as Art Pop Singer-Songwriter, plus some Chamber Pop, Hip-Hop, Vocal Jazz, and Soul Jazz stuff. The important thing for me about his music is his singing style and voice.
