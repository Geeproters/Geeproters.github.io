I talked about it on rec 323, but Neurofunk is a subgenre of Drum and Bass that emerged from Techstep in the late 1990s, with a sound sometimes considered "dark". Music journalist Simon Reynolds coined the term “neurofunk” in an interview with The Wire in late 1997, describing the genre as being centered around clean production, eerie electronic synths and extremely complex basslines. Here's a more modern neurofunk album than the one I recced a few months ago. From Noisia, "Outer Edges":
