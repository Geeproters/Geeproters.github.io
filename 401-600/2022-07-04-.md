Brief intermission from Korean music here. 
CMD094 is a Dreampunk, Ambient, and Chiptune producer, as well as member Kuroi Ame and Co-founder of Pure Life. 

Dreampunk is a derivative genre of Vaporwave beginning in the mid-2010s. Dreampunk largely formed out of vaporwave artists wanting to experiment with more minimal and atmospheric compositions, while also distancing their music from the sample based 1980s nostalgia of vaporwave.  

On August 6, 2021, what, at the time, was said to be his last release dropped, with the following statement:  "ЧЖ043  The last EP.  All money raised will go to CMD094.  After contracting the coronavirus, CMD094 had an inflammation of the cerebral cortex, damaging his auditory nerve resulting in potentially permanent hearing loss. He is currently on a course of medication, but this is expensive and if this is not successful then surgery may be required, costing upwards of 12k"  Following a year-long hiatus after that release, CMD094 has returned just 11 hours ago with a new album - ‘ARIA’. It's a departure in style from previous releases to create his take on the classic JRPG soundtrack.

It still recognizably his dreampunk style (which isn't particularly exciting to me, but it's nice to share the good news about someone I've listened to in the past).
