Around a week ago I talked about a drone metal album (Boris at Last -Feedbacker-), this time I'll rec a purer drone ambient album. Like most ambient drone music, its mellow, minimalistic, and atmospheric. Stars Of The Lid ‎– Stars Of The Lid And Their Refinement Of The Decline. (2007)
 CA 7 0:00 / 2:00:45 Stars Of The Lid ‎– Stars Of The Lid And Their Refinement Of The Decline (full album)
