Rad by Rad Museum is a 2022 contemporary R&B Album, as well as the Seole-born artist's debut album. I listened through some of the songs with Greg a while ago and it seemed mid. After a more thorough listen-through it's really grown on me. Lot's of nice harmonies, and some really clean production. 

I'd say that the very first track (God's Work) is one of the worst on the album up until the 2 minute mark where it takes a sudden shift for the better. I think that might have turned quite a few people off from it.

This makes a full week's worth of only South Korean music, so I'll leave it at that for now and do something different next time. I still have a lot of Korean music I'd like to talk about (mostly indie rock), that I'll get around to doing fairly soon
