Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness is a 1995 Alternative Rock album by The Smashing Pumpkins. It also falls into the genres of Dream Pop, Grunge, Art Rock, Hard Rock, and Alternative Metal. Propelled by the album's lead single, "Bullet with Butterfly Wings", it debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 246,500 units. An important album for mid-90s alt-rock and grunge. It's a long listen, at 2 full hours. "Tonight, Tonight" and "1979" and my two favorites off the album.
