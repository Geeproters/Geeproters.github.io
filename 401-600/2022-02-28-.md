"Emerging from a pool of influences closely associated with the Memphis Rap revival of the early 2010s, Phonk music quickly rose to popularity in online scenes, and Soundcloud in particular, where it's commonly made by producers from all over the globe. Phonk implements into an Instrumental Hip Hop setting influences from a varied array of hip hop genres, including, but not limited to, drum programming and other prominent features of 2010s Trap music, the aforementioned percussion sounds and vocal samples of Memphis rap, and less prominently - Cloud Rap, Chopped and Screwed, and Lo-Fi Hip Hop's laid-back Jazz samples and Downtempo undertones. Certain other forms of Electronic music are occasionally present as well, in addition to influences and samples from other forms of classic Hip Hop, and Southern Hip Hop in particular, though influences from the West and East coast are also present, occasionally in the form of G-Funk-like Funk loops. 

Even though different producers developed different visual styles with time, the genre commonly features surrealist, gothic imagery and titles, and psychedelic, distorted, DIY-esque graphics usually in pink or purple color palettes. These are sometimes meant to evoke a sense of nostalgia, as with other 2010s online trends (eg. weirdcore, webcore). While the term 'phonk' was originally popularized by SpaceGhostPurrp and the Raider Klan collective for their eerie, dark Memphis rap style, it quickly came to be used for an associated-yet-separate scene with a comparably lighter, more "screwed" and jazzier sound, originally spearheaded and popularized by DJ Smokey."

 Dj Akoza - Vol. 1

Aggressive Phonk is a subgenre of Phonk that has experienced a surge of popularity in the past couple of years. Personally, I think it could be described without the Phonk label, as it generally puts aside the jazzy and downtempo elements of Phonk in favor of a purer, darker hip-hop-based sound, and is intentionally subversive of the original genre. Here's some of what I'm talking about:

all aggressive phonk sounds similar, but L19U1D on Spotify is good for more of this stuff
