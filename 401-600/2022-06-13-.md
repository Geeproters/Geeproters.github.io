Nothing particularly new this time, just two albums from the late great Japanese fusion and jazz musician Hiromasa "Colgen" Suzuki. The first is "Primrose" from 1978. good jazz with some post-bop and modal influence.

The second is "High-Flying" from 1976. Came out a couple years earlier, but this one is more interesting to me. It goes in a jazz-fusion direction with some significant funk.

https://youtu.be/oZame1Brs9k Each of the 7 tracks of this 40 min album feel important and indispensable. The first and last tracks (starting 0:00 and 35:20) are killer. The vocals are reminiscent of the Aria OST (see the second song on rec 461). The second track (starting 4:16) is excellent jazz-funk.
