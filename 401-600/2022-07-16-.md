Here's another "Mashup" work, albeit a more traditional one.  The Grey Album is a mixtape by Danger Mouse (one of the two halves of Danger Doom). It mixes music from The Beatles' White Album and raps from Jay-Z's The Black Album. I don't think you need to hear those albums to appreciate or enjoy this one, but some might consider it important. 

On Rym, it's ranked #2 for 2004, #279 overall

The main complaint people will have about this album are the beats not fitting. Overall it's pretty hit or miss, it seems. I like it, but I can understand why people don't.
