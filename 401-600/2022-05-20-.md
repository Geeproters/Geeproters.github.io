[USA] is the third studio album from American chiptune-based pop and rock band Anamanaguchi, released on October 25, 2019. Anamanaguchi helped bring chiptune and bitpop to wider audiences throughout the 2010's with their music, combining those genres with power-pop and punk rock styles. [USA] is one of their more inventive albums. Absolutely interesting for anyone who likes in chiptune. Otherwise, I'm not sure how interesting this album will be. A good number of [USA]'s tracks mix acoustic and digital instrumentation and genre, that can be heard from the first track.

The album is at times ethereal, off-putting, or energetic. The first two tracks are the strongest, in my opinion.
