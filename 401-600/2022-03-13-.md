Here are a couple tracks from the previously mentioned duo "Dead Can Dance," one of the groups who pioneered the genre of neoclassical darkwave:
 The Host of Seraphim (Remastered)

 Dead Can Dance - Yulunga
https://youtu.be/sJqUbb-WuPQ (1993) Really good. Listen to their album "Within the Realm of a Dying Sun" from 1987 for more of this stuff.
