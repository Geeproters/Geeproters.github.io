Speaking of different takes of Utopian Virtual, here are 2 more albums. 
 CURSEBREAKER X by Equip
https://youtu.be/vYwEbM3LAig - 2019 - (sequencer and tracker sound, meant to sound more like video game music than muzak. Whether this is true Utopian Virtual is a matter for debate) 
 Shoot the Moons by Graham Kartna
https://youtu.be/VVxNZXWrzio - 2016 - (music starts 0:22. This one's more Synthpop/Hypnagogic Pop. It's fully infused with Kartna's recognizeable weirdcore style (see rec 153))
