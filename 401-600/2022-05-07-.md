It's been a while since I entered Digital Fusion (I've just been listening to less) so here are a few more I've found and enjoyed recently.
 WIGGLECORE
https://youtu.be/utLsUt6-VsA - This one leans into footwork and wonky. The EP this comes from, Dirt Bird, is my favorite of this bunch.
 Drayx - Retroheaven [Future Bass]
(removed) - More chill, just future Bass.
 [House] U.A.D - DJMAX OST
https://youtu.be/WLBIISh58cA?t=7 - More dubsteppy, some glitch.
 Cabro Artico - Neko Café (ft. M A R Iマリくん)
https://youtu.be/HkFdUm_7qiU - This one's stretching the definition of digital fusion. Japanese vocals and samples with a nice cinematic-orchestral sounding backing, with a jazzy feel. Lots of use of glitch throughout which is what I’m taking the “digital from.”
