"Lo-Fi" emerged during the advent of the American underground scene in the 1980s as a raw, noisy style of Indie Rock. Its name stems from its use of low-fidelity production and recording equipment, giving it an unclean and distinctly ramshackle sound. Here's a newer Lo-Fi / Slacker Rock album, "DSU" (2014), from Alex G. Also falls into the categories of Neo-Psychedelia and Bedroom Pop. Here's the first song on the Youtube playlist.
 alex g | "after ur gone" (official video)

 Waiting for You (Bonus Track)
https://youtu.be/DnAjvl93AEc Still, the whole album is at least worth listening to for anyone who likes lo-fi rock. Highlights being "After Ur Gone", "Harvey", "Skipper", and of course "Waiting For You".

Another nice breakcore track. This one is very atmospheric.

Next 3 recs are gonna be on some different subgenres of House. House itself is a large, hugely popular group of related Electronic Dance Music styles, initially developing from Disco in the early 1980s.
