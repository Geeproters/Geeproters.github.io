Jamaican Ska

The first wave of Ska originated in Jamaica with groups like The Skatalites, who combined Jazz and Rhythm & Blues with rhythms of traditional Caribbean Music like Mento and Calypso. The unmistakable rhythm of ska is defined by the strong emphasis on the off-beats. Horn sections, busy and walking bass lines, and smooth vocal harmonies are also characteristic of Jamaican ska.

The original sound of ska developed in post-WWII Jamaica, where musicians were influenced by United States radio stations broadcasting New Orleans R\&B, Jump Blues, and shuffle-blues music. Initially ska was a Jamaican counterpart to this southern blues music, but quickly developed into a unique style. The notable off-beat guitar rhythm work heard in tracks like Fats Domino's "Be My Guest" was a heavy influence on the development of Jamaican ska. Due to the country's then lack of acknowledgement of international music copyright protection, local bands would often perform covers of popular North American and British shuffle and rock songs in this new style.

The genre was most popular during the 60s
