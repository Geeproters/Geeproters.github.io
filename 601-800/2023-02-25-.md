Ragtime

Ragtime (or just Rag) is a popular piano-led style that emerged in the 1890s. It is considered one of the first forms of music inherent to the USA, beginning as a dance accompaniment in African American communities, particularly Missouri, before being popularly circulated as piano rolls and sheet music. Together with Blues, ragtime paved the way for Jazz in the 20th century. The term "ragtime" is thought to stem from its heavily syncopated rhythm, appearing almost "ragged".

Scott Joplin was an American composer and pianist. Because of the fame achieved for his ragtime compositions, he was dubbed the "King of Ragtime". During his career, he wrote over 40 original ragtime pieces, one ragtime ballet, and two operas. His "Maple Leaf Rag", became the genre's first and most influential hit, later being recognized as the quintessential rag. Joplin considered ragtime to be a form of classical music and largely disdained the practice of ragtime such as that in honky tonk.
