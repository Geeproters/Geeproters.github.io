Bhangra originated as a form of Punjabi folk-dance celebrating the harvest. Since the 1990s, Punjabi immigrants in the UK started experimenting with Western instruments, eventually mixing traditional Punjabi Folk Music with Pop, which lead to the creation of modern bhangra. Highly percussion-driven with the beat of the large dhol drum being the main instrument, bhangra is a form of playful music with a strong dance sensibility.
