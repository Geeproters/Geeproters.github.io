A 2005 Album by Casiopea I listened through most of recently and enjoyed. Both bands have pretty massive discographies, so they've been my go-tos for Japanese Jazz Fusion for a few years, right after Masayoshi Takanaka

I've been thinking about how to talk about Chinese Pop music history for a while now. There's so much to say that it would take just over 2 weeks of daily recs to go over the major details. Thankfully, C-Pop can be roughly divided into 3 major categories;  Mandopop, Cantopop, and Hokkien pop (or Tai-pop). I plan on summarizing these three in this order over around 15 recs, with breaks for other music in between. The information I'm giving for each of these genres is mostly from Wikipedia, and it's all gonna be grossly oversimplified. As with most Chinese history, Chinese music history just takes a crazy amount of words to explain well, and I don't have Nitro.

Anyway, we're starting with;
