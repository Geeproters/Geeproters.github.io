Champeta is a genre of music that takes its name from a type of knife associated by Colombian elites with the lower classes. Champeta is heavily influenced by the traditional music of San Basilio de Palenque, a municipality whose modern population descends from maroons, but it also incorporates modern Caribbean and African sensibilities and more recently, digital elements. A typical champeta song is divided in three segments: an intro, a chorus, and a third part named espeluque, which features the song's beat more prominently.
