There Will Be No Super-Slave is a 2022 Political/Hardcore/East-Coast Hip Hop, Chipmunk Soul album by Ghais Guevara.

The production is groovy and Guevara's flow is good. At the forefront is the sampling. The album itself is angry, energetic, rebellious, and playful.

Here're the first two tracks off the album.
