Mod music was created during the 1960s as part of the eponymous youth subculture. The term "mod" was initially used in the late 1950s to describe young British people who were either musicians or fans of the period's popular Jazz styles, but then was acquired through its popular use on 1960s Europe for people who were following various trends, such as original tailor-made clothing, American top 40 music and motorized bikes (mostly scooters and motorcycles). Most people who were following the mod trends listened to genres like Rock & Roll, Rhythm & Blues and Rockabilly. The rising popularity of the scene began to attract the attention of Rock music fans, thus mod music started to generate in 1964 as a clash between both cultures.

The style of most mod music was either British Rhythm & Blues, Beat Music, Garage Rock, Pop or Freakbeat oriented in nature, with the lyrics and fashion styles being the most central point of the overall musical scene
