Gabber (Dutch for "buddy") also known as Gabba or Rotterdam Hardcore, is a fast-paced, energetic form of Techno-rooted Hardcore \[EDM\] which emerged from the Netherlands in the early 1990s. Gabber tracks often fall in the 160-220 BPM range and feature a characteristic distorted kick sound created by overdriving the kick drum from a drum machine such as the TR-909 to the point that it creates a square wave with a recognizable melodic tone. Gabber tracks often feature synthesized melodies, rave stabs, and vocal samples.

Here's Realms of Darkness, a 1995 Gabber album by Australian duo Syndicate. It's also influenced by Speedcore and Terrorcore, which I'll talk more about later.

This one happens to be (probably) the least accessible album I've recced in this series of Techno. Gabber is more Hardcore \[EDM\] than it is Techno, after all. I wouldn't try this one before recs 617-620.
