Proto-punk is a fairly vague term used to describe music that either influenced or resembled Punk Rock before the commercial breakthrough of punk in 1976\. Common characteristics include provocative attitude, use of noise or abrasiveness, wild, untamed energy and stripped-down simplicity. It's closely associated with the Garage Rock music of the 1960s (see next rec)

Sometimes the line between proto-punk and punk rock is blurred â€“ even artists who belonged to the CBGB punk scene of the early-to-mid 1970s have been labelled proto-punk simply because they predate the commercial breakthrough of Sex Pistols.

Here's the 1975 album Horses by Patti Smith. It can loosely be defined as any of Proto-Punk, Singer-Songwriter, Art Rock, Garage Rock, Art Punk, Glam Rock, or others. It was an important album for bridging late 60s American garage rock and the nascent punk scene

It does have those energetic, rebellious elements you get with punk, but it's also playful and quirky. It's a really good album.
