Doom Metal is often considered one of the 5 major subgenres of Heavy Metal, the others being Thrash metal, Death Metal, Black Metal, and Power Metal. I've already covered those last three, and I'll do Thrash Metal some other time.

Doom Metal revels in tension, despair, and dread, prizing atmosphere more than many of metal's other primary subgenres. Doom uses plodding tempos, repeated chords, and thick, distorted, down-tuned guitars to attempt to envelop the listener in a wash of desperate foreboding that commonly lasts to the ten-minute mark and beyond. Instruments generally keep to the standard guitar, bass, and drums, but it is not unusual to add keyboard passages and backdrops.

Doom vocals can be in any of the predominant metal styles, but all share a determined attempt to invoke emotional hopelessness and mental anguish. This is further amplified by the lyrical themes of grief, depression, fear, resentment, and suffering which are hallmarks of the style. Traditional doom metal is a style of Doom Metal that emerged in the early to mid-1980s, under the influence of bands from the previous decade such as Black Sabbath, Bedemon, and Pentagram.

Here's a Doom Metal track from influential Swiss extreme/avant-garde metal band Celtic Frost's 2006 album Monotheist
