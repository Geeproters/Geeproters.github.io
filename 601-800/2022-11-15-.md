Space Disco emerged in Europe in the mid-to-late 1970s, characterized by layers of oscillating synth, space-oriented sound effects (laser guns, spaceships, etc.), and an overall futuristic sound that hit just as Star Wars \[A New Hope\] was released. It is one of the earliest forms of Electro-Disco.

With its use of futuristic sounds and sometimes vocoders, space disco shares some similarities with Italo-Disco, though has more reliance on the spacy atmosphere and less on the melody at the forefront of the song, as well as the latter having an overall more substantial, heavy, "dry" drum machine beat. Space disco is also sometimes confused with and used as a synonym for Spacesynth, a genre that emerged as a strain of Italo-disco with space disco influences, before developing into its own fully fledged style with swirling, euphoric synth melodies.

(you can really hear the "dry" drum machine beat on this one)

From Tantra' 1979 album Hills of Katmandu which falls into both the genres of  Space Disco and Hi-NRG.
