Skacore

Although it began as an underground style, by the mid-1990s ska punk had achieved mainstream Rock success. Bands formed under the influence of the third wave during the late 1980s to the early 1990s, most notably Rancid, Sublime, Goldfinger, No Doubt, and Reel Big Fish, all of which hailed from California. Less Than Jake brought the sound to the east coast of the United States, and were another notable band to bring radio success to the genre.

As British bands pushed the third wave into fusions of 2 tone and Oi\!, North American bands also went in a harder direction, mixing Hardcore Punk with ska to create skacore. Other acts continued to perform in the popular standard ska punk style, and others mixed in elements of Alternative Rock to further develop a unique sound.

Skacore was most popular during the late 90s and early 2000s.

Pretty wacky genre.

And that's all on Ska for now
