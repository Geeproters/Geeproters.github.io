Dub Techno fuses elements of Minimal Techno (see rec 618\) with characteristics of Dub. Those characteristics are used to convey atmospheric deepness and enrichment of textures through sound effects such as echo, reverb, phasing and other sonic manipulation.

Even though a few dub techno works predate them, Basic Channel are often credited as the pioneers of the genre, and helped establish its conventions. Several other influential artists of the genre include Porter Ricks, Monolake, Pole, DeepChord, Vladislav Delay, and more recently Andy Stott.

The genre arose in the 1990s, but had the height of its popularity in the 2010s.

The whole album is 3 hours, so I've yet to listen through it. A lot of people consider this one of the best Ambient/Minimal Techno albums ever. You have to be in the right headspace, but it can be beautifully psychedelic, and wonderfully rewarding.
