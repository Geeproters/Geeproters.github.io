Garage Rock is a genre of Rock distinguished for being relatively raw and energetic, generally employing simple, sloppy, and fuzzbox-distorted guitar melodies in addition to frequent shouting or screaming. The genre emerged in the early 1960s primarily in North America coinciding with the decline in popularity of Rock & Roll, spearheaded by Paul Revere & The Raiders, The Kingsmen, The Trashmen, The Sonics, and The Seeds who incorporated influences such as Surf Rock, Rockabilly, Rhythm & Blues, and Beat Music into their traditional rock & roll template. Since many of these groups featured an amateurish approach to their music and often practiced in their garages, the style was retroactively dubbed as garage rock.

James Newell Osterberg Jr., known professionally as Iggy Pop, is an American singer, musician, songwriter and actor. Called the "Godfather of Punk", he was the vocalist and lyricist of proto-punk band The Stooges, who were formed in 1967 and have disbanded and reunited many times since. He's 75 and fit as a fiddle.

Here's the 1970 album Fun House by The Stooges (led by Iggy Pop). It's Proto-Punk, Garage Rock and Hard Rock, and so it may be easier to hear the sounds that influenced later punk in this.

It's got a distinct manic, heavy infernal feeling that matches the cover art.![][image1]
