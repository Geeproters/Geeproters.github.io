Nerdcore Techno

A portmanteau of "nerd" and "hardcore", nerdcore techno is a style of Electronic Dance Music often centered around the unauthorized sampling or remixing of 1980s and 1990s Japanese (and occasionally western) music, television shows, commercials, video games, anime, and other aspects of pop and/or nerd culture, calling direct attention to the original comedic or nostalgic value of the source material. Inspired by the eclecticism of Denki Groove who helped introduce a number of electronic dance styles into the Japanese mainstream throughout the 1990s, nerdcore techno artists often work with a melting pot of influences and personal twists on the genre, mainly taking cues from Techno, Breakbeat and Jungle; despite its wide scope the overarching genre is still quite distinguishable by its heavy penchant for sampling and raw, DIY approach to production. In early years the use of the term often overlapped with J-core, but the two genres have since diverged greatly with the latter emphasizing sleeker, more contemporary Hardcore \[EDM\] trends in lieu of niche interests and irreverent sampling.
