All About Lily Chou-Chou is a 2001 Japanese film, written and directed by Shunji Iwai, that portrays the lives of 14-year-old students in Japan and the effect the enigmatic singer Lily Chou-Chou's music has on some of them. yotsu's edit of TOKYOPILL's E t h e r e a l from rec 442 happens to use footage from the movie, if you're wondering what it looks like.  
   
Lily Chou-Chou is a Japanese band that debuted in 2000\. Initially a fictional band that produced music for the film, but the group later reformed in 2010 for the 10th anniversary of the film. In the canon of the film, Lily Chou-Chou is a single character.

I haven't seen the movie, but the backstory is pretty interesting. For example, Chou-Chou was born at the same time as John Lennon's assassination. She also has an official website, Lilyholic, which features as a back-story and plot element to the film, including news articles and a discography.

Anyway, here's the soundtrack for the movie. Really nice Downtempo Dream Pop with an ethereal, malancholic or lethargic feeling.
