Following the commercial failure of Disco, and Punk attempts to further their agendas, a number of trends that appeared in New York during the early 1980s came together as mutant disco. It combined disco with elements of Funk, Post-Punk, and a spirit of experimentation and blending different sounds from Jazz, Hispanic American Music, and Dub, as well as Hip Hop.

While mutant disco artists created left-field music that consciously resisted generic constraint, the sound coalesced around a core of funky basslines, syncopated grooves, and angular, sometimes abrasive guitar riffs. Its integration of post-punk aesthetics into a beat-driven framework would situate mutant disco in parallel to early New Wave. When present, the vocals are often quirky, ironic, or subversive, may include rapping, screaming, and weird vocal sounds.

Key to mutant disco’s development was major label withdrawal from New York’s party scene in the 1980s, shifting club play toward local independent music and reconnecting artists to the DJ-dancefloor nexus against which radio was favored during disco’s peak

By nature, this genre is suuper diverse. Worth exploring for oneself.
