Rocksteady

Rocksteady is a style of Jamaican popular music that blossomed briefly between 1966 and 1968\. Compared to its predecessor Ska, rocksteady was slower, more relaxed, and soulful. The rhythm, especially the bass, became more prominent, the bass lines more intricate, and horns took a supporting role in the background.

Rocksteady was typically performed by vocal harmony trios like The Heptones, The Paragons and The Techniques as well as solo performers like Alton Ellis and Phyllis Dillon, most often singing smooth, romantic love songs. The American soul scene was a big influence, especially The Impressions. Another theme associated with rocksteady was rudeboys, young Jamaican gangsters and troublemakers. Most popular artists wrote songs for or against 'rudies'.

Most of the stars, musicians and producers from the rocksteady era remained key figures when the music evolved into Reggae, sometime around 1968\.
