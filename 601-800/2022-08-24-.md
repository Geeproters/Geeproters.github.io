It's been around 440 days since I last talked about Silent Hill music here. Back then I had said that it was "some of the best video game horror ambience there is." I wanna take that back, and change my statement to "The very best video game horror ambience," and for me, (for Silent Hill 2's music in particular), my favorite ambient video game music in general.

As one might expect, it's sombre, dark, cold, and ominous, but also atmospheric, melodic, and lonely. "Eerie yet beautiful" describes the music of very few Soundtrack artists as well as it does the work of Akira Yamaoka.

With all that said, you do need to be in the right mood to enjoy it. When you are, though, the vibes are immaculate.

Here's the full soundtrack for the second game. Released 2001\.

Silent Hill 2's OST also belongs to the genres of Trip Hop, Dark Ambient, Industrial, Alternative Rock, although Ambient is obviously at the forefront.
