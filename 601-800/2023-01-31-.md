Middle Rennaissance (1410's or 20's – 1521\)

The middle period is dominated by Franco-Flemish School and the four-part textures favored by Johannes Ockeghem (1410's or 20's – 1497\) and Josquin des Prez (late 1450's – 1521).

The designation Franco-Flemish School, also called Netherlandish School, Burgundian School, Low Countries School, Flemish School, Dutch School, or Northern School, refers, somewhat imprecisely, to the style of polyphonic vocal music composition originating from France and from the Burgundian Netherlands in the 15th and 16th centuries as well as to the composers who wrote it. The spread of their technique, especially after the revolutionary development of printing, produced the first true international style since the unification of Gregorian chant in the 9th century. Franco-Flemish composers mainly wrote sacred music, primarily masses, motets, and hymns.

Five groups, or generations, are sometimes distinguished in the Franco-Flemish/Netherlandish school:

The First generation (1420–1450), dominated by Jean Tapissier, Guillaume Du Fay  
(see previous rec)

The Second generation (1450–1485), with Ockeghem as its main exponent

The Third generation (1480–1520): with Josquin des Prez as its main exponent.

The Fourth generation (1520–1560), and the Fifth generation (1560–1615/20). By this time, many of the composers of polyphonic music were native to Italy and other countries: the Netherlandish style had naturalized on foreign soil, and become a true European style.
