Here's a genre I stumbled across recently. Pretty weird what happened to it. See this rec for old Makina and the next rec for new Makina.

The original Makina sound was a local Spanish form of Techno developed in the early 1990s, which was strongly influenced by New Beat and EBM, but aimed for a lighter sound, more suitable for rave parties. In its early form it was referred as "Bacalao" and spawned popular compilations series such as "Techno Valencia" or "MÃ¡quina Total". During the early 1990s, artists such as Chimo Bayo and Paco Pil achieved a huge success in Spain.

A substyle called "cantaditas" (or "pastelitos") was derived from Makina and appeared in the mid-1990s as a reaction to the dominant instrumental sound of the Makina DJ sessions of the time, which alienated the most Pop oriented clubbers (particularly girls). It was influenced by Eurobeat and based on very simple and ultracatchy 'cloying' melodies easy to singalong, hence the name "cantaditas". Many of these popular tunes were covers of old pop hits.
