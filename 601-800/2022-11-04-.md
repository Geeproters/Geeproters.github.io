Highlife, AKA  Hi-Life, or Osibi.

Highlife originally began along the Ghanaian coast in the 1920s as a blend of western brass band instrumentation and rhythms with traditional Akan Music and Dagomba Music. Highlife bands traditionally played for the colonial elite in clubs and hotels, and the term 'highlife' was coined to reflect this.

As the genre grew more popular towards the 1950s, it gradually drew more influence from other popular western genres such as Jazz & Swing as well as Calypso (more on this some time later). This influence of various western styles led to the development of Burger-Highlife, which incorporated elements of Disco and Funk into the highlife sound. The genre splintered between dance and guitar-driven bands in sync with the growing popularity of guitar-driven music in the Western world, which lead to the foundation of Afrobeat. Despite a falling-off in the 1960s, highlife remains widely popular in Ghana and its neighboring countries.
