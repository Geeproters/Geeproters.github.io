加爾基 精液 栗ノ花 (Kalk samen kuri no hana) is a 2003 Art Pop/Rock and Progressive Pop album by 椎名林檎 \[Sheena Ringo\]. It takes influence from Chamber Music, Jazz, Progressive Pop, J-Rock, Noise Pop, and Experimental Rock.

Complex song structure, uncommon instrumentation, and lots of variation on each track make the album a fun, hectic listen.

Two tracks off the album:  
[椎名林檎 (Shiina Ringo) \- 迷彩 (Meisai)](https://youtu.be/WbUNBDizSIQ) (very jazzy, favorite of the album)  
[椎名林檎 (Shiina Ringo) \-- 茎 ("Stem")](https://youtu.be/iSkWRifJBvU) (almost symphonic)

Must have been crazy to put this album together, yet it all works great.

The next 5 recs will be on a few sub-classifications of Techno

Techno is a broad term initially applied to the Electronic Dance Music that originated in Detroit during the late 1980s (now referred to as Detroit Techno, see rec 430), a style heavily influenced by Electro, though now encompasses various subgenres from all over the globe. Generally speaking, techno music is beat-driven (typically in 4/4) and repetitive in nature, with minimal chord variation. It is aimed for the club environment, where numerous records can be mixed together throughout the night, though it has inspired more stripped-down styles such as Ambient Techno and Minimal Techno which are often better suited for home listening. Similarly, the rise of a multitude of Hardcore \[EDM\] scenes has pushed the genre to its limits and towards near-undanceable levels.
