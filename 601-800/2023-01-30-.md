Early Rennaissance (c. 1397–1474)

The early period of rennaissance music corresponds to the career of Guillaume Du Fay (c. 1397–1474) and the cultivation of cantilena style.

Considered the leading European composer of his time, Guillaume Du Fay's music was widely performed and reproduced. His most most admired work is the complex motet Nuper Rosarum Flores, which celebrated the consecration of Filippo Brunelleschi's dome for the Florence Cathedral

Before Du Fay's time, the concept of a 'composer'—that is, a musician whose primary occupation is composition—was largely unfamiliar in Europe. The emergence of musicians who focused on composition above other musical endeavors arose in the 15th century, and was exemplified by Du Fay.
