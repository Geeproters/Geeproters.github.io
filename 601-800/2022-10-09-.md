Freakbeat is a genre of Rock music closely related to the Mod scene of the 1960s. Freakbeat bands took elements of British Rhythm & Blues, Beat Music and Pop Rock and mixed it with the studio effects of Psychedelia \- fuzztones, flanging, chorus \- to create a type of music often seen as a British relative of American Garage Rock and Psychedelic Rock.

While most of the groups who exemplified the sound of Freakbeat music were obscure, British artists, such as The Creation, The Sorrows and Les Fleur de Lys, it is also sometimes applied to acts who had greater success, such as The Who, as well as bands from other, usually European countries, such as Germany's The Boots and France's 5 Gentlemen.

Here are a few freakbeat tracks:
