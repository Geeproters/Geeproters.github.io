Conscious Ragga

The mid-1990s saw a rise in spiritual and socially conscious lyrics, birthing a substyle of "conscious ragga" exemplified by artists like Sizzla, Anthony B and Capleton.

From Anthony B's 2003 album Street Knowledge:

\[Intro\]  
Do your work, do your duty\!

Yaga yaga, yaga yaga yaga  
Yaga yaga, yaga,  
Yaga  
Yea\!  
Yaga yaga,  
Yaga yaga yaga pass me sword and my daggar

\[Chorus 1\]  
Who want the dancehall fi stop? Police\!  
Who no want fi see herbs ah shop? Police\!  
Who kill the youths pon the block? Police\!  
Them no want fi hear truth, much less facts

Who want fi see hearse a drive? Police\!  
Ah the easiest man fi bribe? Police\!  
Them no want fi see ghetto survive? Police\!  
As we see them, ghetto youth haffi dive

\[Verse 1\]  
A who have the legal long gun?  
Who ah murder the youths dem a Jamdown?  
Who have innocent youths locked down?  
Ask the herb farmers who burn the herbs down  
From me a little youth me know  
Every man haffi go reap what them sow  
A whole heap of innocent brains them blow  
Whole heap a blood them flow

\[Chorus 2\]  
Who want the dancehall fi stop? Police\!  
Who no want fi see herbs ah shop? Police\!  
Who kill the youths pon the block? Police\!  
Them no want fi hear truth, them no right thoughts

Who want fi see hearse a drive? Police\!  
Ah the easiest man fi bribe? Police\!  
Them no want fi see ghetto survive? Police\!  
As we see them, ghetto youth haffi dive

\[Verse 2\]  
I see them everyday pon the highway  
Roadblock dem have pon the freeway  
See dem every night  
Nah do no right  
Now run fi search you at the stop light  
Inna the helicopter with dem spotlight  
(That's why them lock off the light, want bear dark night)  
Big foul play  
That the world ah say  
Fi the murdering of breathen weh dem

\[Chorus 3\]  
Who want the dancehall fi stop? Police\!  
Who no want fi see herbs ah shop? Police\!  
Who kill the youths pon the block? Police\!  
Them no want fi hear truth, them no right thoughts

Who want fi see hearse a drive? Police\!  
Ah the easiest man fi bribe? Police\!  
Them no want fi see ghetto survive? Police\!  
As we see them, ghetto youth haffi dive

\[Verse 3\]  
Me look and see: laws and order ah collapse  
So you haffi be careful or them caught you inna dem trap  
Dem nah lock you up them a lick out your head back  
See it there, inna the city bagga dagga dak  
The almshouse\!  
Lootin' and shootin' must stop  
And that's why Anthony B ah bun the fire hot  
Me call the youths dem from Jungle and Rimma back  
The youths dem from Waterhouse the valley, we want you see  
Aye, Mama cry\! oh why oh why oh why?

\[Closing Chorus\]  
Who want the dancehall fi stop? Police\!  
Who no want fi see herbs ah shop? Police\!  
Who kill the youths pon the block? Police\!  
Them no want fi hear truth, them no right thoughts

Who want fi see hearse a drive? Police\!  
Ah the easiest man fi bribe? Police\!  
Them no want fi see ghetto survive? Police\!

The Jamaican Patois that wasn't obvious to me:

Yaga Yaga: to express a greeting or attract attention, i.e. yo\! or yush\! This is predominantly Dancehall slang.  
Fi: colloquial way of saying for. Can also be used to replace the word 'to' in a sentence.  
Pon: on, upon.  
Ah: to be, am.  
Haffi: a conjuntion of have \+â€Ž fi, from the English have to.  
Jamdown: (Sometimes "Jamdung") Meaning Jamaica; commonly used when highlighting reggae and weed  
Bear: only.  
Bagga: from 'bagga mouth' \- Slang expression used to refer to a person who is all talk but no action  
Dagga: from 'dagger'. Also refers to a popular dance which originated in Jamaica. This dance involves a male dry humping/grinding on a female in various positions  
Almshouse: foolishness or stupidity.

My favorite song from the past couple dozen recs.
