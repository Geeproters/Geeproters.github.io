Hispanic American music is a general term that includes the musical genres that were created by Hispanic Americans from Latin America, the Caribbean and the United States. Obviously, this category is very diverse and includes many different styles like the Mariachi of Mexico, the Merengue of the Dominican Republic, the Tango of Argentina, the Son cubano and Rumba cubana of Cuba, and various other styles like Salsa, Cumbia and Reggaetón, just to name a few. I've gone over some popular styles and musician from this genre already (Such as recs 520 through 526), and I'll continue working through it gradually.

For this rec, a little on Santana.

Santana is an American rock band formed in San Francisco in 1966 by Mexican-born American guitarist Carlos Santana. The band has undergone multiple recording and performing line-ups in its history, with Santana the only consistent member.

Here's their album Abraxas from 1970, belonging to the genres of  
Latin Rock, Psychedelic Rock, Blues Rock, and Jazz-Rock. It's warm, rhythmic, and psychedelic. This album became the band's first to reach number one in the United States.

I timestamped Oye Como Va \- "listen to how (my rhythm goes)." Lots of jojo references recently\!  
It's not what I typically listen to, but this album is pretty fun.
