Ambient Techno

First emerging in the late 1980s and early 1990s, ambient techno blends the mechanical, repetitive beats of Techno with atmospheres and textures inspired by Ambient music. In contrast to most techno, the music is intended more for home listening than a club environment, resulting in slower tempos and more understated rhythms, and often a more melodic or emotive style. Many of the earliest ambient techno artists came from the British techno scene, including key early names such as The Black Dog, B12, Aphex Twin, Kirk Degiorgio, and Reload.

Selected Ambient Works 85-92 is the most popular and highest-rated ambient techno album by far (a whole .29 ahead of the next highest on RYM). It's also the highest-rated album of 1992, and the 4th highest-rated electronic album of all time (beside Kid A, Vespertine (rec 594), and Dummy (rec 607))
