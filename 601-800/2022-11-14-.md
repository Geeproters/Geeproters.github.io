Hi-NRG developed during the end of the 1970s on the heels of Electro-Disco and quickly became the most popular Electronic Dance Music genre in the LGBT club scenes of San Francisco and New York.

The seminal Donna Summer single "I Feel Love" (1977), produced by Giorgio Moroder, is widely credited to be the first Hi-NRG song and made a huge impact on the club scene. In an interview, Summer described it as having a "high-energy vibe", which became the name for the entire genre.
