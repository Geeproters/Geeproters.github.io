The Ghost\~Pop Tape is a 2013 album by Devon Hendryx, later known as JPEGMAFIA. It belongs primarily to the genres of Alternative R\&B, Ambient Pop, Art Pop, and Electronic, and secondarily to the genres of Vaporwave, Hypnagogic Pop, Cloud Rap, Experimental Hip Hop, Sound Collage, and Downtempo.

This album, along with his "Dreamcast Summer Songs" (next rec) which was released the year prior, helped to define and popularize both the genres of Vaporwave, as well and Lo-Fi Hip Hop. To what exact degree they did this is debated, and generally denied by Peggy himself.

The Ghost\~Pop Tape Hypnotic and Nocturnal. Infused with feelings of alienation, as well as sex and sexuality, through its samples and lyrics.

It's gloomy and surreal, and an interesting listen I much enjoyed. Peggy never misses, even from before he was Peggy.
