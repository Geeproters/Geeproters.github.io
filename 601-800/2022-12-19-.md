Deejay

Deejay, or Toasting, Chatting, is a form of Reggae in which a deejay (similar to an MC in Hip Hop) talks or chants their lyrics over a pre-recorded reggae rhythm. The style originated in the 1960s during the Ska era where the deejay used the sound system—the equipment and associated personnel used to broadcast music—to chat between tracks or insert catch phrases over the track. This was influenced by American R\&B radio disc jockeys who used to chat in between songs they played and is where the name comes from. It was made popular during the early reggae era by deejays such as U-Roy and Dennis Alcapone. Deejaying became more prominent than singing by the 1980s during the early Dancehall era and is the dominating style in modern Ragga.

A reggae deejay should not be confused with a DJ (disc jockey) who selects and plays music. Reggae disc jockeys are called "selectors".
