Dembow

Dembow is a music genre which originated in the Dominican Republic during the early 1990s. It is influenced by Dancehall, "Reggae en español" (the Afro-Panamanian version of Reggae and dancehall) and Hip Hop. Vocals are usually rapped in a fast-paced manner in urban Dominican vernacular, el barrio lingo.

During the early 2010s DJ Scuff and Chimbala led a wave of innovation, and producers started combining different dancehall riddims (e.g. "dembow", "fever pitch", "drum song"), adding zany samples and incorporating influences from Funk carioca, merengue, reggaeton and US hip hop. Notably, El Alfa and his producer Chael started adding Trap elements to dembow, pioneering the sound often called "Trap Bow".

From El Alfa's 2020 album El androide:

Emanuel Herrera Batista, known professionally as El Alfa El Jefe, or simply as El Alfa, is a Dominican rapper, known as "The King of Dembow"

Whereas early dembow featured catchy and repetitive phrases about money, women, machismo and consumer goods, its lyrics have evolved to also include sharp punchlines and witty wordplay. Through the late 2000s and 2010s, with the rise of dembowseras such as Milka La Más Dura, La Materialista and La Insuperable, female sexuality and empowerment started appearing as a lyrical theme.
