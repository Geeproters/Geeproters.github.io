Space Age pop, also known as bachelor pad music, was inspired by the optimism of the Space Age of the 1950s and 1960s and its excitement about mankind's space exploration. Space Age pop is especially related to Lounge music, and could be seen as an early occurrence of space music.

The music somewhat varies in style, rhythm and arrangement. Space Age pop often uses a string orchestra (or simulated strings) to apply warmth and color to the sound, combined with a Hispanic American Music percussion section. Keyboard instruments (both traditional ones, and later also electronic) are frequently used, as well as the theremin for its unique eerie sound. The arrangements often convey a sense of humor, placing it in close relation to later futurist or space-themed novelty music \- a closeness furthered by the album cover artwork often displaying space or modernist themes.

Mort Garson's 1976 album Mother Earth's Plantasia I recced on 267 also falls into this genre, as well as the genre of Moogsploitation which I'll talk about soon

During the early 1990s, Space Age pop, largely forgotten after 1965, regained some of its popularity (see next rec).
