Minimal Techno

Developing in the early 1990s out of the second wave of Detroit Techno by artists in Detroit and Southern Ontario such as Robert Hood, Richie Hawtin, and Daniel Bell, minimal techno features a stripped-down sound that was seen as a reaction against maximalist, rave-oriented European styles of Techno and Hardcore \[EDM\] and a return to form of Detroit techno's ethos. Minimal techno tracks are usually repetitive and sparse in instrumentation, frequently featuring little more than a drum machine and a looping analog synth line, and sometimes taking elements from Acid Techno, as seen with Hawtin's Plastikman alias. The genre rose to popularity in Germany, as exemplified by Basic Channel, who would combine minimal techno with production techniques from Dub to create the derivative genre Dub Techno.

Here's a track from Swedish-born artist The Field's 2007 Minimal Techno album From Here We Go Sublime.
