Thumri

Thumri is a classical style based on North Indian folk literature. The common themes for a Thumri are romance, separation and devotion. Since the poets who composed the early Thumris were devotees of Lord Krishna, most of the Thumris describe a female devotion to the Lord.  The present form of Thumri is supposed to have originated in Lucknow between 1847 and 1856 though the similarity of Thumri with Khyal suggests an earlier origin.

Ali Akbar Khan was an Indian Hindustani classical musician of the Maihar gharana, known for his virtuosity in playing the sarod. Trained as a classical musician and instrumentalist by his father, Allauddin Khan, he also composed numerous classical ragas and film scores.

Rajdulari Aliakbar Khan's Raga Kirwani / Raga Imni Bilawal, from 1967:

I timestamped to just before my favorite section. That said, the whole performance is a worthwhile listen.
