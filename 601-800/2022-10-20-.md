Death doom metal is a style developed out of a concoction of Death Metal and Doom Metal. It emerged from the trend of death metal bands incorporating doom metal's plodding tempos, somber atmosphere, and bleak lyricism. Quickly, two main styles emerged: melodic death doom, which features both clean and harsh vocals, slower paces and focuses on creating a dreary mood by utilizing guitar effects and non-standard instruments; and a riff-focused one, which retains old-school death metal distorted guitar playstyle, double-kick drumming, blast-beats, tempo swings, and growls, and integrates doom metal's hefty, down-tuned sound.

The first signs of death doom metal can be traced to the early 1990s. In opposition to the need for Metal to be as fast as possible and filled to the brim with riffs, some bands opted to include slower dynamics.

By the mid-1990s, death doom metal became a well-established style that featured prominent scenes in the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Finland. diSEMBOWELMENT mixed ethereal guitar lines with harsh, dense rhythmic sections and deep growls
