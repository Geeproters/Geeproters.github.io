Endtroducing..... is a 1996 Plunderphonics album by American DJ, songwriter and record producer DJ Shadow. As described before, plunderphonics describes the compositional technique of utilizing and manipulating one or more recognizable recordings to create a new composition.

Endtroducing..... is an album made entirely of samples from vinyl records, produced over two years using an Akai MPC60 sampler and little other equipment.

Interestingly enough, DJ Shadow has claimed to own well over 60,000 records. Shadow's breadth of influence and attention to detail means that, even over 25 years later, the only person who knows where every sound on this album comes from is Shadow himself (although collaborative lists have gotten very close).

It is the highest rated Instrumental Hip Hop, Experimental Hip Hop, and Plunderphonics album on RYM.

the album also belongs to the genre of Turntablism, which is similar to plunderphonics, but distinct. I'll talk about it soon.

Here's my favorite track timestamped, which happens to sample Bjork's “Possibly Maybe.”  
The whole album is an absolute experience, even though I could hardly place any of the samples.

One more tidbit, this album also happens to sample Meredith Monk and is thus the second plunderphonics album I've recced to do this (afaik), see rec 452\.
