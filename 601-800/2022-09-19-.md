The modern interpretation of Makina bares resemblance to Happy Hardcore related genres, made distinguishable from contemporary styles by a characteristic bass sound, the timbre of which uses a higher octave than UK Hardcore productions, and a punchier kick drum to convey a "bouncy" feel.

One of the first Makina tunes to gain exposure on an international scale was supposedly Streamline by the duo Newton, as the song was featured in a Pepsi commercial. The genre's popularity has since spread to other areas, notably Northeast England, but also, apparently, Japan?

Music can develop and popularize in some very unexpected ways these days. I'm just inferring here, but I personally think most of the odd spread of Makina is due to a few major social music phenomena, including:  
1\. Dance Dance Revolution helping to popularize similar genres across the world  
2\. Japan's late 90's Techno Craze  
3\. Similarities to the UK's Happy Hardcore music, which was also extremely popular
