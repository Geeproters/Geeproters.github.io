One more easy-listening style in this series of 5\.

Adult contemporary is a genre with roots in the light Pop of the 1960s; however, the term came to the fore in the late 1970s and early 1980s when the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart replaced the Easy Listening chart and when it also became a successful radio format. Unlike Easy Listening, adult contemporary is a predominantly vocal form, and it can incorporate elements of Contemporary Country, Smooth Soul, or Smooth Jazz.

With adults as a target audience, the genre tends towards slow to mid tempo songs that follow familiar patterns and are intended to be soothing rather than invigorating. Some overlap exists between adult contemporary and Soft Rock, but adult contemporary is one step further removed from Rock and may utilize more pop instrumentation, be that lush strings in the 1960s or synthesizers in the 1980s and later.

Many of the notable stars of adult contemporary are also known with adjacent genres. This includes 1970s Country Pop stars such as Anne Murray and Kenny Rogers, Contemporary R\&B stars such as Lionel Richie, Singer-Songwriters such as Barry Manilow and Neil Diamond, and Latin Pop stars such as Julio Iglesias.
