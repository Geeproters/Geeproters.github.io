This playlist is pretty much all I've been listening to for the last 3 or 4 days.  
[The Sound of Glitchbreak | Spotify Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5aPKPDrqsxBQSST33NOsFw?si=91fa7e474a1a416b)  
Most of the tracks here I wouldn't really call glitch break, but as a breakcore playlist, man is it good.

lots of artists I'm familiar with ([\[Lolicore\] Loli in early 20s \- Various Types Of Ads](https://youtu.be/0c5NwW9P8ig))  
as well as those less familiar to me ([Amethyst Sex Magick](https://youtu.be/OWQyPlMfaxE))
