Cheat Codes is a 2022 Conscious/East-Coast Hip Hop album by Danger Mouse & Black Thought.

This one is shaping up to be one of the highest-rated albums of the year, currently ranked \#3 for 2022 on RYM. Danger Mouse is great, Black Thought is great, and around half of its tracks feature other artists. It's well put together. The album itself is usually pretty mellow, poetic, triumphant, and a bit bittersweet

Three of my favorite tracks:  
[Danger Mouse & Black Thought \- Belize (feat. MF DOOM) (Official Audio)](https://youtu.be/oKwmu0kE4JE) (nice homage to DOOM)  
[Danger Mouse & Black Thought \- Because feat. Joey Bada$$, Russ, and Dylan Cartlidge (Official Video)](https://youtu.be/10RM92UFt_A)  
[Danger Mouse & Black Thought \- Strangers (feat. A$AP Rocky and Run The Jewels) (Official Video)](https://youtu.be/yPdHD1neCV8)
