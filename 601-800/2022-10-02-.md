His most viewed video is TIMELAPSE OF THE FUTURE: A Journey to the End of Time (4K), released 2019 and with more than 95 million views now.

It's a deeply existential video, worth putting away a good 30 minutes to take in. I think I've watched or listened through the video back to front a few times now, just because it's so well made.

I take something different away each time, and there aren't too many videos that will do that for me. The music is very good too.
