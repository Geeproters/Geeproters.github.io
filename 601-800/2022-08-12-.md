Symphonic Black Metal is a sub-genre of Black Metal that emerged in the mid-1990s. It was pioneered and popularized by artists like Emperor, Arcturus, Dimmu Borgir, Bal-Sagoth, Cradle of Filth, and Nokturnal Mortum. The genre is characterized by typical black metal elements, such as tremolo-picking riffs, shrieking vocals and blast beats, in addition to synthesized and symphonic soundscapes. Naturally, actual orchestral instruments can be used instead of, or in addition to the keyboards.

Anthems To The Welkin At Dusk is a 1997 album by the Norweigen ensemble Emperor. It belongs to the genre of Symphonic Black Metal.
