Brutal death metal is a subgenre of Death Metal that emerged in the early 1990s. Brutal death metal typically utilizes triggered blast beats, chunky, fast riffing, and rhythmic "slam" riffs, popularized by Suffocation.

Brutal death metal was pioneered by bands such as Suffocation and Broken Hope, who replaced the Thrash Metal influences and higher-pitched harsh vocals of earlier death metal heavyweights such as Morbid Angel and Entombed with chaotic, amelodic riffage and deep guttural vocals. Brutal death metal bands frequently use winding or labyrinthine song structures, overlapping with Technical Death Metal in the process. Some brutal death metal bands double down on the genre's inherent intensity and eschew overt technicality in favor of combining the genre with Grindcore subgenres like Goregrind or Deathgrind (more on that later). In spite of these stylistic differences, cross-pollination is not uncommon. Violent lyrics about gore are a brutal death metal mainstay, though some bands, such as Wormed, opt to use science fiction or even Lovecraftian-influenced lyrics inspired by Demilich.

I have a feeling this type of sound is what comes to mind most often when most people think of Death Metal.
