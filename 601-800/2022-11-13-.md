Electro-disco is an influential Disco subgenre in which disco instrumentation is largely \- if not entirely \- replaced by synthesizers and augmented with futuristic elements such as the vocoder. The genre displays a strong influence from Kraftwerk.

The most popular and influential electro-disco producer is Giorgio Moroder. Hi-NRG developed from electro-disco, but is devoid of disco's Funk elements. The futuristic Space Disco and Italo-Disco are other offshoots.

The genre is notable for being the first major Electronic Dance Music subgenre.
