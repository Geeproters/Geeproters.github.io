Arabic Folk Music

Arabic Folk Music makes reference to the different forms of Traditional Folk Music of Arabic regions. The wide extension of Arabic cultures lent to the creation and expansion of numerous forms of Arabic Folk Music. It's based on the maqam system of the Islamic Modal Music, but with a more populist approach than Arabic Classical Music, being used in religious chants, weddings or dances. Arabic Folk Music is mainly vocal, but also generally accompanied by instruments like the nay, arghul, mijwiz, rabab, duff, bandir, tar, and darbukkah. There exist typical forms of songs like the qasida or the ataba, based on the maqam modal system. Some of the most common Arabic Folk Music subgenres are Arabic Bellydance Music and Bedouin Music, which I'll leave for another time.

This is obviously an extremely diverse genre, which I'll probably return to in greater depth much later.

For now, these two works I enjoy:

Eclipse by Hamza El Din (Egypt), released 1978\.  
[Hamza El Din "Eclipse"](https://youtu.be/Eilt7b6c6vg) Nubian Music, relatively traditional Arabic Folk Music

أينما ارتمى (Aynama-Rtama) by Elif, released 2015  
[Alif \- Holako (Hulagu) الألف \- هولاكو](https://youtu.be/X-0K2A-WnHE) This one is Avant-Folk, rather than traditional folk, but also a great listen.
