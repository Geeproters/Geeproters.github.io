I'm still working towards disco, slowly but surely.  
   
Little break from that for this:  
[Elephant Gym \- Underwater \- Full Album \- 2018](https://youtu.be/oAwNf9Zy2UU?t=95)  
just give this one a couple minutes from here.

I focused on Taiwanese math rock / jazz fusion elephant gym on rec 380, and their music appeared on the compilations on rec 99\. Just a really nice, chill math jazz sound.

There are a few features on the album that people seem to not care for, but I think it's nice that they're trying new stuff. For some reason this track isn't included in the above video:
