anyway here are my thoughts on this breakcore meme  
[Mr Incredible Becoming Canny  (Breakcore)](https://youtu.be/Lj2w2GnNvLE)  
NTR Ending \- a decent breakcore remix, Sewerslvt (see rec 393\) is able to make relatively simple and uncreative breaks sound good. I think that both LORN's (see rec 7\) music is better unremixed, and to me this feels like one of Jvne's weakest works.

Fine Night \- Not actually breakcore, it's more just high-speed drum and bass. That said, Goreshit (see recs 390, 393\) makes good stuff when they're not being a deranged weirdo, and this is one of those instances. Ethereal vocals with the tangible drums are somewhat reminiscent of "Dreamcore" (see 534).

Sakura no eda \- Loli in early 20s (see recs 442, 626\) makes good glitchcore, usually less weird than the name would imply, certainly less weird than Sewerslvt and Goreshit.

Puddle of Nitrogen \- Kaizo Slumber (formerly Acetantina (see rec 595)) has ambient house/chillwave stuff down pat. This song's more Footwork / Vaportrap than breakcore, but you could argue that it has those elements of glitchcore.

Resonance \- DV-i. Now this is good stuff. They make Hardcore Breaks, Drum and Bass, Breakcore. This song has a classic (2010s) feel to it, despite coming out 2021\.

Ghost \- DJ Kuroneko. I listen to this artist a lot, but I haven't recced their music because to me it doesn't sound particularly inspired, despite being well made.

Cyberia lyr3 \- The second track from this meme by Sewerslvt. This one's got more of their sound in it. Depressive and aggressive breakcore. Good stuff.

Fuck Up Your Face \- This was the track that helped me get into Machinegirl's discography outside of Wlfgrl (see rec 67). Its really really good. Hard not to dance to.

Ginger Claps \- of course, a track from Machinegirls' Wlfgrl, which got a lot of people into breakcore (maybe me too, but it's been too long so I can't quite remember)

All those tracks in order:

[Machine Girl \- Ginger Claps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfaIRtlywTo)

I said that DJ Kuroneko's work sounds uninspired to me, but I should mention that their more recent stuff is really good, and they're making a sound for themself that I really like.

I'm surprised there was no TOKYOPILL (see rec 442\) in the meme. Definitely one of my favorite ethereal breakcore artists, and pretty popular too.

Here's some things from an album of theirs that came out this year.

[TOKYOPILL \- Godspeed](https://youtu.be/zpfSbsswr84)

One more breakcore song from this year. This is the first and only thing I've heard from ooxygen, but they seem to have the chops for ethereal breakcore.  
[ooxygen \- care (feat. Pukey)](https://youtu.be/WCJvZepKDWQ)

on rec 387 I recced an album by Venetian Snares. His album Rossz Csillag Alatt Született came out 2005\. Another artist, Ghost, took some clear inspiration from the album with their 2016 album Exploding Geometry.

To me, this treads the line between homage and plagiarism (listen through the first couple tracks of Rossz Csillag Alatt Született to see what I mean). At the same time, it's good, so whatever.

[Ghost \- Running With Scissors](https://youtu.be/cQTeLCcR8O8)

Here's something else by Ghost that showcases their originallity more. Nice clarity and disposition in the breaks, nice synths, nice samples/keys. At around 2:58 you get some strings again with that classicore feel, but it doesn't sounds too much like the way Venetian Snares uses them.

I said I was gonna talk about Mutant Disco next, but I've decided that there's too much context for the genre I havent covered yet, that I don't wanna skip.

Thus, the next few recs will be providing some context for the rather wacky genre that is mutant disco.

To begin, perhaps unexpectedly, we'll start by talking about a few native genres of Ghana, southern Togo, southern Benin, and the Ivory Coast, those being Akan, Ewe, and Dagomba.
