Ragga

Ragga refers to modern Dancehall, in particular to a more hardcore style with a deejay (equivalent to an MC in hip hop) rapping over predominately digital (electronic) rhythms. Ragga developed towards the late 1980s out of the more melodic Digital Dancehall that in the mid-1980s had popularized digital instrumentation in reggae and dancehall. With its sparse rhythms and aggressive vocals ragga moved even further away from Reggae (ultimately also alienating many traditional reggae fans). Gradually, the rhythms grew increasingly sophisticated, with producers making full use of synthesized instruments and sampling.

Deejays had become increasingly popular throughout the dancehall era, with ragga they became near synonymous with the genre and sported increasingly gruff-voiced or rapid-fire deliveries, with deejays like Shabba Ranks, Ninjaman, Bounty Killer, Buju Banton and Beenie Man dominating the dancehall scene in the 1990s. A number of ragga artists have also achieved a level of crossover success, frequently by assimilating influences from Hip Hop and Contemporary R\&B. Sexually explicit lyrics (known as "slackness") and violent themes are dominant lyrical themes alongside lighter dancehall topics.
