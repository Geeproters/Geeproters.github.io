Acid Techno

Evolving out of the Acid House scene and arguably from German Trance in addition, acid techno combines the elements provided from the aforementioned relatives into the frame of regular Techno, tending to be more energetic and using a series of Roland instruments like the TB-303 and other synthesizers to utilize its layers. This includes unconventional adjustments among these instruments to achieve its famous "acid" sound.

Here's The Tuss (AKA Aphex Twin, Brian Tregaskin, Karen Tregaskin)'s 2007 Acid Techno album Rushup Edge.
