Amy Jade Winehouse (1983-2011) was an English singer and songwriter. She was known for her deep, expressive contralto vocals and her eclectic mix of musical genres, including soul, rhythm and blues and jazz.

Lioness: Hidden Treasures is a posthumous compilation album featuring some of her unreleased music.

First, this is one of her most famous and popular songs (873M views on youtube). From 2006:

And one from Lioness. Released posthumously 2011:  
[Amy Winehouse \- A Song For You (HQ)](https://youtu.be/AAWmJN_eIdQ)

She isn't enunciating her words very well in that second track. She might have been intoxicated, as an assumption on my part. Still, her voice sounds as beautiful and smoky as ever.
