Viking metal is a subgenre of Metal with roots in Black Metal, especially from the Blood Fire Death and Hammerheart albums by Bathory. Some of the most common features of Viking metal are powerful, clean vocals and epic choirs, galloping riffs and drumming, rich anthemic keyboards, and the use of Nordic Folk Music instruments such as fiddles, flutes, and blowing horns. Like Black Metal, Viking metal releases often incorporate shrieks and blast beats and often have a cold, sad atmosphere, though the tone can instead be triumphant. True to its name, the lyrical content of Viking metal is often focused on Norse mythology and the Viking Age.

Hammerheart is a 1990 album by the Swedish ensemble Bathory. It belongs to the genre of Viking Metal.

That's all I'll do on Black Metal for now. I'll also do Death Metal later.
