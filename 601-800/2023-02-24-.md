I'm surprised I haven't recced this person before.

Hiromi Uehara (known professionally as Hiromi) is one of my favorite jazz pianists. She is known for her virtuosic technique, energetic live performances, and signature blend of musical genres such as stride, post-bop, progressive rock, classical and fusion in her compositions.

Here she is playing with The Trio Project with one of the masters of Bass Anthony Jackson credited with the development of the modern six-string bass, as well as jazz, fusion and rock drummer Simon Phillips who played with Toto from 1992 to 2014\. Check out the rest of the concert too if you're interested.

It's lovely hearing someone have so much fun with their music, and hard to think of another musician who embodies that more than Hiromi, even in more subdued or "serious" performances like this one:

Next 5 are on some genres related to ragtime.
