Various countries nd regions each have their own distinct takes on disco.  
   
Italo-Disco is produced primarily in Italy and is characterized by the use of synthesizers, drum machines, and sometimes vocoders to create a mechanical, Electronic version of Disco with futuristic atmosphere. It originated in Europe in the late 1970s. Following the decline of Disco, it reached its peak level of popularity in the early- to mid-1980s. Italo-Disco was not exclusively confined to Italy, with Germany and other European countries producing music in this style; its name is derived from The Best of Italo Disco series of compilations.

In Japan, Disco intermingled with and influenced the upbeat, funky genre of city pop. For more on this, see rec 502, in which I also talk about the genre of Boogie, which I'll talk about again next rec.
