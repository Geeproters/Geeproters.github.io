Praise be to the youtube algorithm for bringing me to this album the very same day it was posted, today October 8th.

Exactly 600 days ago on rec 59, I talked about a few albums by Ryo Fukui, a Japanese jazz pianist whose work has seen a spike in popularity after his death.

By that point I had already listened to all of Fukui's stuff I could find. Those albums are some of my favorite jazz albums ever, Hard Bop mixed with Cool Jazz in such a perfect way.

Finally, all this time later, I've stumbled upon something that perfectly scratches that Ryo Fukui shaped itch.

Besides the stuff by Fukui, I have yet to find a jazz album I personally enjoy as much as this.

Finding Takashi Mizuhashi in particular has also brought me to a trove of other, hopefully similar jazz, from his various projects that I'll be listening through in over the coming months, getting me through my courses.
