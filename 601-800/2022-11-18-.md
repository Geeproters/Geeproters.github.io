Seen by many as a continuation of Disco, boogie was developed just as disco music was starting to go into commercial decline. Despite retaining disco's dense arrangements, Soul style songwriting, and four-on-the-floor feel, it has a slower tempo, more pronounced Funk and R\&B influence, more heavily syncopated harmonies and melodies, and a stronger emphasis on the 2 and the 4 (accented snares/claps). Boogie frequently borrows from the sound palette of Synth Funk (and occasionally Electro), featuring machine driven rhythms and filter modulated synth leads/bass.

Boogie was particularly popular in New York and the most relevant record labels were Prelude Records, Sam Records, Easy Street Records and Salsoul Records. Although this genre went into decline in the late 1980s, nowadays it has a massive cult following, and boogie releases are highly sought after by record collectors.

If you haven't listened to Ride on Time by Tatsuro Yamashita, a City-Pop Boogie album I talked about on rec 502, it's a really fun listen

Boogie is my favorite Disco offshoot, followed by Mutant Disco (next).
