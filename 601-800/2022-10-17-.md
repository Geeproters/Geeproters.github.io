Dissonant death metal is a style of Technical Death Metal that utilizes dissonant, angular, sometimes chugging and atonal riffs, scratchy leads, and various techniques such as squealing dive-bombs and pinch harmonics. Bass guitar is often heavy-handed to create a counterpoint to high-ended lead guitar, while drummers incorporate off-kilter rhythms. Song structures are usually unconventional and often feature uncommon time signatures.

Although rawness and rhythmics became an inherent part of a significant portion of Death Metal sound since its inception in the 1980s, angularity and dissonance (also known as "skronk") gained the interest of various more technically proficient groups in the 1990s, such as Death who were one of the pioneers of tech-death. Following bands that were influential to dissodeath, Demilich and Immolation, pushed the envelope, with the former utilizing off-kilter drum work and jagged, complex songwriting, and the latter relying on dense, dissonant walls of sound created by simultaneous usage of arduous drumming and guitars using tremolo picking, power chords, and pinch harmonics.

The 1998 Avant-Garde, Dissonant Death Metal album Obscura, by Gorguts:

In response to the streamlining of death metal, Gorguts, on their third effort, Obscura, opted for an Avant-Garde Metal approach, adopting discordant guitar harmonies, atonal riffing style, spastic drumming, unconventional time signatures, and squealing leads created by techniques such as finger tapping, feedback, pick scraping and dive-bombing.

The album would later become the blueprint for future bands seeking to adopt a highly dissonant and unintuitive style.
