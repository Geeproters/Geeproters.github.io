あらためまして、はじめまして、ミドリです。 (Aratamemashite, hajimemashite, Midori desu.) is a 2008 album by     ミドリ \[Midori\].

A somewhat eclectic blend of genres, "あらためまして、はじめまして、ミドリです。" combines Noise Rock, Jazz-Rock, Experimental Rock, Post-Hardcore, and Swing Revival (1990s alternative take on swing music, incorporating elements from newer genres such as Rockabilly, Ska, and Punk Rock) all into an Jazz Punk package. This specific sub-genre of Art Punk, which is described as Jazz-Punk, is actually not too uncommon in Japan. Many consider this to be among the best Japanese Jazz-Punk albums ever. And I agree. It's really very good, and one of my favorite Art Punk albums, but it's absolutely not gonna be for everyone

It's manic, aggressive, noisy, and chaotic, but also playful.

Anyway, it's the type of thing you need to listen to to get. Here's my favorite track off the album:
