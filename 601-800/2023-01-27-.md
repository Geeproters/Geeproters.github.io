Ars antiqua

Ars antiqua represents mainly sacred European medieval music from the period of 1170 to 1310\. Ars antiqua marks the birth of the measure of time in music, the notion of "artist" for the composer who now can have a name \- instead of being an unknown artisan working for "the eternity of God"; also the creation of the first polyphonies for four voices almost freed from the Plainsong and ternary beat domination. The genre got its name from the composers of the next musical period, Ars nova, in opposition to their new way of structuring musical polyphonies.

One of the first and primary composers of ars antiqua (near 1170-1310) is PÃ©rotin (or Perotinus the Great) who wrote the first polyphonies for four voices: Sederunt principes / Adjuva me, Domine Deus meus and Viderunt omnes / Notum fecit Dominus salutare suum. To achieve those masterworks, he utilized the measure of time in music. In fact, it was impossible to coordinate four voices together without counting time.
