The Paisley Underground scene emerged in Los Angeles in the early 1980s, giving birth to a distinctive style of Neo-Psychedelia—sometimes known as "paisley pop" to distinguish it from the scene—that blended the upbeat and melodic style of then-contemporary Power Pop, Jangle Pop, and New Wave with the surreal sonic atmosphere of 1960s Psychedelic Rock and Psychedelic Pop. Another common influence came from paisley's crossover with the concurrent Garage Rock revival. Though its melodic sensibilities derive primarily from 1960s Pop Rock, it retains a Post-Punk edge in its jangling guitars and incorporation of psychedelic elements, and these artists were consequently considered part of the first wave of Alternative Rock.

The original Los Angeles scene included The Three O'Clock, The Dream Syndicate, Rain Parade, The Long Ryders, Green on Red, and most famously The Bangles, whose popularity soon eclipsed the original scene.

The genre declined at the end of the 1980s as harder-edged groups began to dominate the alternative scene, and paisley groups either broke up or reconfigured into new groups like The Loud Family and Mazzy Star that modernised the sound and combined paisley songwriting with punchier Indie Rock and the atmosphere of Dream Pop. Though it was ultimately short-lived, the Paisley Underground scene and paisley pop in general were highly influential on later neo-psychedelic artists and movements, both those closer to home—California's Jellyfish in the early 1990s and The Orange Peels in the 2000s—and further away, such as the Elephant 6 collective and jangly British Indie Pop groups like The Stone Roses and The La's.
