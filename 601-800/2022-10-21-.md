Sludge metal is a subgenre of Metal that combines the slow, dark instrumentals and atmosphere of Doom Metal with the aggressive, harsh screams and shouts credited to Hardcore Punk. A typical sludge song places heavy emphasis on guitar feedback, groovy riffs, and angry, pained vocals. It also isn't uncommon for songs to engage in occasional quick bursts of speed and technicality attributed to more traditional forms of hardcore. Lyrical themes borrow both from the angry social and political commentary of punk and from the sad and melancholic themes of doom metal. This amalgamates into music that can best be described as frustrated and embittered, often either at society or at oneself.

The term "sludge" is a metaphor referring to the slow and dingy atmosphere this blend of metal and punk invokes.

Many bands have also used the vocals and tempos of sludge with textures and stylings of other atmospheric genres like Post-Rock, giving rise to Atmospheric Sludge Metal. Sludge is also considered to be a major influence on modern Powerviolence (more on this when I talk about grindcore later).
