Pål Moddi Knutsen, known by the artist name Moddi, is a Norwegian musician, author, and activist, whose contemporary folk music often includes songs of protest or social justice.

His 2016 album Unsongs consists of 12 songs from different countries that were each banned at some point. The countries include but are not limited to Israel, Lebanon, Russia, Chile, Mexico, Norway, and Vietnam.

Topics mainly focus on different facets of racism and war. These songs resulted in music bans, prison sentences, and murder of the artists.  
Here's some more info on it, though it doesn't cover  every song. [Unsongs](https://www.unsongs.com/)

Moddi's voice is unique and I'm a sucker for cliche orchestral swells and the like.

Here's the original Kate Bush version of Army Dreamers from 1980, which I might prefer.

The song was blacklisted during the Gulf War in 1991 – joining a list of 67 songs simultaneously banned from BBC airplay, including The Beatles, Frank Sinatra, ABBA and Queen.
