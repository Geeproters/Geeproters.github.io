Pagan black metal is a style of Black Metal that incorporates elements of Traditional Folk Music, such as instrumentation and folk songs' melodies, but retains the distorted tremolo-picked guitar and driving rhythmic section. Pagan black artists frequently use the acoustic guitar and add clean, epic singing, vocal harmonies, and chants, sometimes even removing harsh vocals. Although raw production is prevalent, it reduces the intensity and creates its signature atmosphere through sparser sections, buildups, acoustic passages, or an ample amount of synthesizers. Pagan black thematically focuses on paganism, mythology, folklore, and, occasionally, ancient history and war.

Bergtatt: Et eeventyr i 5 capitler is a 1995 album by Norweigen ensemble Ulver. It belongs to the genre of Pagan Black Metal.
