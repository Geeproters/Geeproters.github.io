Euro-Disco is a European style that moved away from the genre's Rhythm & Blues and Soul roots, speeding up the tempo and adding Electronic instruments like synthesizers and drum machines as a backing for more melodic Europop-influenced vocals. Cerrone's Love in C minor arguably defined the Euro-Disco sound. Compared to early US Disco most Rhythm & Blues and Soul influences were replaced by more electronic sounds using synthesizers, drum machines, faster BPM and metronomic, monotonous rhythms, often accompanied by lush and sweeping strings, the 'campness' and overemphasis on melody of Europop and the disparate influences of Continental Europe local styles of music, ranging from Rumba flamenca (Santa Esmeralda) to Polka (Dschinghis Khan).
