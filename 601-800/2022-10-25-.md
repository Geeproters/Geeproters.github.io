1970s:

Due to the continuation of the civil war, the 70s were mostly uneventful from a musical perspective. However, non native-language Taiwanese pop music was still being produced.

Perhaps most notable for this period was the early rise of Fong Fei-fei, whose cover of White Peony I recced on 676\.

Fong Fei-Fei, born Lim Chiu-Luan (1953-2012), was a Taiwanese singer, host and actress. As one of the greatest singers in Taiwan, she was known for her melodic love songs, unique personal stage style and broad vocal range. In a 40 year career spanning 1971–2010, Fong released more than 80 albums, sang over 100 movie theme songs and starred in several films and television variety shows. She is remembered for her songs like “Wish You Happiness,” “I am a Cloud,” and “The Wild Goose on the Wing.” Fong died in 2012 due to lung cancer.

In recognition of her contribution to Taiwan's music industry, she was bestowed with the Special Contribution Award during the Golden Melody Awards ceremony in 2013\. Nation's cultural minister Lung Ying-tai called her "Taiwan's national singer".

She had a nice voice for sure.
