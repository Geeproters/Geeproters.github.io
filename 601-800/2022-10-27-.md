1990s: Reintegration, to present

In 1990, Lim Giong launched the first successful Taiwanese album under Rock Records. It also broke away tradition by having a new-ballad style instead of the old-enka style.

In 1993, Taiwan's government opened up the broadcasting of TV or radio programs to languages other than Mandarin.

In the mid-1990s, Taiwan became the centre of one of the largest music industries in Asia. The country was the second largest music industry in Asia, in 1998 and 1999, after Japan, before falling to fourth in 2002 due to piracy. I talked about this before on the mando and cantopop recs, but piracy caused domestic repertoire as a proportion of the market to fall to 50%, in 2001, from an all-time high of around 70%, in the 1990s. Sales of recorded music in Taiwan peaked in 1997, when sales reached US$442.3 million, but by 2008, revenue declined sharply to US$51 million, with piracy and illegal downloads to blame. Foreign songs began to dominate local repertoire for the first time in the mid-2000s, as they did in Hong Kong and Mainland China.

Kulilay Amit, better known by her stage name A-Mei, is a Taiwanese Puyuma (one of the indigenous groups of the Taiwanese aborigines) singer and record producer. In 1996, she made her singing debut. In the following decades, she won 3 Golden Melody Awards for Best Mandarin Female Singer Having sold over 50 million records, achieving success in the Mandarin-speaking world, and often being referred to as the "Queen of Mandopop," despite her origins.
