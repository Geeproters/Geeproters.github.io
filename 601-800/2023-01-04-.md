Ancient Greek Music

In Ancient Greece, music was considered a major art. People attributed it to virtues and magical powers on souls, and philosophers deemed the importance of music for education as well as personality development. The themes and songs usually deal with Greek mythology.

Ancient Greek Music has its own form of writing, one of the first known musical theories and writing systems. Some of the papyrus musical notation discovered were Seikilos' Epitaph, some Mesomedes of Crete's Hymns, some Euripides' notes of Orestes and Iphigenia at Aulis, and few fragments of the Delphic Hymns.
