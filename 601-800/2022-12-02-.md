mikgazer vol.1 is a 2012 vocaloid album in the style of Shoegaze (see rec 545).

[Various Artists \- Mikgazer Vol. 1 \[2012\] \[HQ\]](https://youtu.be/oKwa_Yp9dK8?t=285)

Each of the 12 tracks is produced by a different artist, so some tracks are more enjoyable than others. That said, this is overall a very comprehensive album.

The shoegaze riffs and melodies work really well with Miku's vocals, but the production, which in general is just great especially considering that this is (for the most part) not a typical genre of these producers, really ties the album together.

I expected a gimmick album, and was met with an interesting and well-produced compilation with something for both shoegaze and vocaloid listeners.

Tracks 2, 7, and 8 are my favorites.
