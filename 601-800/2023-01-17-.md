Qawwali

Qawwali is a form of Sufi Music in India and Pakistan using the raga and tala templates of Hindustani Classical Music. The ecstatic, trance-like singing reflects its origins in Sufi culture. The primary instruments are tabla, dholak, handclaps and harmonium. The rhythms are more aggressive and repetitive than other styles of Hindustani classical music like Khyal. The style is frequently adapted in Filmi and South Asian Pop music.
