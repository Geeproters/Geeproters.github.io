Burger-Highlife (or Burgher-Highlife) is a form of Highlife music created by Ghanian immigrants to Germany in the late 1970s. The genre commonly employs synthesizers and western post-production techniques alongside guitar-driven highlife instrumentation. Coined by George Darko, the word 'burgher' originates from the German word for 'citizen'. Darko describes the genre as being more rhythmic and danceable than traditional Highlife, borrowing from Disco and especially Funk music. This approach to Highlife has been criticized by several Highlife producers for diluting its Ghanan influence due to its deep fascination with Western tastes.

Beginning in the 1950s, Makossa \- meaning "(I) dance" in the Duala language of Cameroon \- is a musical style that is similar to Soukous, but Makossa makes more use of a horn section and bass rhythm. It has its origins in Kossa, a type of dance associated with the Duala people, and has also taken influence from various modern styles such as Jazz, Highlife and Rumba Cubana (550). By far the most famous Makossa musician is Manu Dibango, whose single Soul Makossa became a massive international hit and was a key point in the development of Disco.
