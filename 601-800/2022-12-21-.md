Digital Dancehall

Digital dancehall is a form of Dancehall music that emerged in the mid-1980s with the King Jammy-produced "Under Me Sleng Teng" by Wayne Smith.

The main characteristic that makes it different from the first forms of dancehall is the rhythms are digital rather than having the traditional backing band. After the Sleng Teng hit digital dancehall became the standard style in dancehall, up until the early 1990s where the more hardcore style of Ragga took over.
