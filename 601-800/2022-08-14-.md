Melodic black metal is a sub-genre of Black Metal that emerged in the mid-1990s. Dissection and Sacramentum are considered to be the pioneers of this genre. While keeping the main characteristics of black metal, such as fast tempos, shrieking vocals, tremolo picking, and frequent blast-beat use, melodic black metal differs from its parent in several ways. It is usually less aggressive, straightforward, raw, and minimalistic than typical black metal, often lacking the cold and sinister atmosphere associated with its parent genre.

Storm of the Light's Bane is a 1995 album by the Swedish ensemble Dissection. It belongs to the genre of Melodic Black Metal.
