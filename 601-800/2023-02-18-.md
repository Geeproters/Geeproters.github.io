Her masterful fusion of UK Drill and East Coast Hip Hop is unique and inspired. Deep bass and complex rhythms denotes a Grime influence in the production.

Her deadpan lyrical delivery belies the playfully hedonistic content and lends to a surreal, dreamlike quality.

Her 2023 release Like..? is the EP of the year for sure
