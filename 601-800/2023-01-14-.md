Dhrupad

An ancient style of Classical Indian vocal and instrumental music. As opposed to the more popular Khyal style, Dhrupad is more meditative and often omits the faster, more songlike gat-passage of a raga. The Dhrupad is drone-based and often played solo; if any rhythm instrument is used at all, it is the pakhavaj rather than the tabla.

Zia Mohiuddin Dagar, popularly known as Z. M. Dagar, was a North Indian classical musician, one of the 19th generation of Dagar family dhrupad musicians. He was largely responsible for the revival of the rudra vina as a solo concert instrument. From his 1991 album Raga Yaman:

Asad Ali Khan was an Indian musician who played the plucked string instrument rudra veena. Khan performed in the style dhrupad and was described as the best living rudra veena player in India by The Hindu. He was awarded the Indian civilian honor Padma Bhushan in 2008\.
