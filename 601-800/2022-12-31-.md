Here's an album from 2022 I quite enjoyed. I think its quite underrated

Marina Herlop \- Pripyat:  
[Marina Herlop \- Pripyat (2022) \[Full Album\]](https://youtu.be/zp2GPNRoHvQ?t=745)

Dreamy and quirky vocals, an interesting fusion of classical/folk and electronica, beautiful choral elements, a deconstructed feeling that's never boring. Above all, very atmospheric.

Herlop also combines glitch elements with deconstructed club, and what you get is more unique than Bj√∂rk \+ Sweet Trip \+ Arca, but also clearly influenced by many styles. To be experimental and accessible in the right balance is difficult to pull off, but I think Marina Herlop has done a great job.
