The Postal Service is an American indie pop group from Seattle, Washington, consisting of singer Ben Gibbard, producer Jimmy Tamborello, and Jenny Lewis on background vocals. The band released their only studio album, Give Up, in 2003 on Sub Pop Records, to mostly positive reviews. The group decided to disband two years later, viewing attempts at a follow-up as unnecessary.

With just one album, The Postal Service established themselves as pioneers of a genre-bending sound that continues to influence contemporary music.

This album strikes "a canny balance between indie kitsch and electro eccentricity" \[https://www.theringer.com/music/2023/9/5/23857852/postal-service-give-up-20th-anniversary-tour-history\].

Here's the most popular track off the album.
