Suomisaundi

Suomisaundi is a Finnish-based deviation of Psytrance with an emphasis on free-form experimentation and humor. The "Suomi" style is also popular in Australia and New Zealand. It often has organic sound like Goa Trance, but not uncommon are elements like Humppa, Techno, Punk Rock, Breakbeat, Spoken Word, Hip Hop, Industrial Metal, different kinds of Traditional Folk Music, funky guitar playing, video game music and cheap vintage electronics. "Spuge" means "an alcoholic" and the drunken feel is apparent, also the lyrics and titles are usually about everyday life.

Here's Texas Faggott's 2000 album Petoman's Peflett
