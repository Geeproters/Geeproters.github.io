when Genghis Khan first united Mongolia (13th century), many different tribes were brought together, and this allowed sharing of music that had not happened before. Urtiin duu was one such style, widely believed to have originated 2,000 years ago.    

Уртын дуу (urtiin duu, aka long song) is a main form of Mongolian Music in which sung syllables are extended into long, meditational, vibrato notes called shuranhai; a four-minute song may only consist of ten words. Other features are a slow tempo, wide intervals and no fixed rhythm. The richer and longer hold a singer has, the more appreciated the singer. Lyrical themes vary depending on context; they can be philosophical, religious, romance, or celebratory, and often use horses as a symbol or theme repeated throughout the song. Eastern Mongols typically use a morin khuur (horse-head fiddle) as accompaniment, sometimes with a type of indigenous flute named limbe. Oirat groups of the Western Mongols typically sing long songs unaccompanied or accompanied with the igil.

Here's one long song, performed by Мягмарсүрэнгийн Дорждагва \[Myagmarsürengiin Dorjdagva\], a long-song singer from Mongolia and an independent long-song researcher.
