I spoke about Jane Remover, an American musician most well known for her 2021 debut studio album Frailty as well as her pioneering of the "dariacore" microgenre, on rec 541 after she had completed her Dariacore trilogy. This time I wanted to talk about this Hard Dance, Mashup, EDM, Hardstyle, Speed House, Deconstructed Club, Bubblegum Bass, Hard Trance, Happy Hardcore, Bass House, Euro-Trance, Nightcore-influenced album of hers from earlier this year, Grave Robbing. This was also released under her leroy alias, and is the first to be released following the completion of the Dariacore series.

60 minutes of dense and excessively produced dance rhythms built on samples spliced from pop and occasionally hip-hop. Every song flows into the next nicely, and it never really stops for the whole hour. Like Remover's other work, trying to recognize as many of the samples as I can while listening is fun and rewarding.
