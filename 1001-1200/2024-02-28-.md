Memphis rap emerged in the early 1990s, originating in Tennessee through DJ Spanish Fly's gritty spin on Electro, reflecting the bleak Memphis environment. It features minimalist half-time drum machine programming and aggressive rapping with a double-time flow. Influential artists include Gangsta Pat, DJ Squeeky, and Three 6 Mafia. Originally distributed via cassette tapes, it's associated with lo-fi aesthetics and sinister imagery. Despite DIY production, some samples from Soul or Horror movies were used. Crucial in the 2000s Horrorcore movement, Memphis rap influenced Crunk and fell out of popularity in the early 2000s. However, it saw a revival in the early to mid-2010s with artists like Lil Ugly Mane and Raider Klan.
