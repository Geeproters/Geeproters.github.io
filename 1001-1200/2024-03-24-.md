Jùjú is a popular genre of Yoruba Music that emerged during the 1920s in urban settings across Nigeria, especially in Lagos. It was pioneered by Tunde King, a guitarist that fused elements of the incipient Palm Wine Music from Sierra Leone and Ghana, the music brought by British colonists, and traditional Yoruba music. The first jùjú recordings were made in 1936 by Tunde King and his band, which included an acoustic guitar (a banjo), sekere, tambourine, agidigbo and drums. After World War II, the pedal steel guitar began to be used instead of the acoustic guitar, and the electric bass guitar replaced the agidigbo. These innovations were brought by artists such as Ayinde Bakare, I.K. Dairo and most notably King Sunny Adé, who became one of the main exponents of the genre together with Ebenezer Obey, who was influenced by Funk, Reggae and Afrobeat. These two artists were largely responsible for the great popularity of the genre during the 1970s, when ensembles expanded to over 15 musicians. By the 1980s, the success of the genre began to decline due to the popularity of Fuji. Some artists such as Sir Shina Peters tried to reconcile jùjú and fuji to gain a wider audience. Nonetheless, artists such as Bola Abimbola continued to cultivate the genre as done before.
