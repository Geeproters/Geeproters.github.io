Hi-tech Psytrance

Hi-tech psytrance (Hi-Tech, Hitek Psy) is an offshoot of Dark Psytrance that emerged in the mid-2000s. Blending elements of darkpsy and Full-On Psytrance, the genre is most well known for its extreme tempo, which can exceed 200 BPM. While best known for its high tempos, it is primarily defined by an exaggerated emphasis on glitchy, jittering sound design as well as complex rolling bassline patterns that often change significantly throughout the course of a track. These elements give hi-tech a dense and chaotic sound even beyond that of its influences, but it retains a focus on clean and clear production, often exchanging the grim atmospheres of darkpsy for a lighter and bouncier feel aided by its usage of sharp and punchy percussion.

The first hi-tech producers emerged from the Russian psytrance scene around 2005, when artists such as Psykovsky and Kindzadza began to increase the density and complexity of their darkpsy compositions, introducing sound design elements from contemporary full-on productions. The genre began to take shape over the next few years with the help of other pioneering artists such as Cosmo and Highko (whose label Noise Poison Records became an important early hub for the genre) as the tempo was steadily pushed, eventually establishing an average of at least 160 BPM.

While early hi-tech was primarily produced and popular in eastern Europe and Germany, it enjoys worldwide popularity, with strong followings in western and southern Europe, where it enjoys an association with Hardtek (see rec 644\) due to the prominence of AstroFoniK's OVNI Records imprint, and Latin America, where it is served by collectives such as Pleiadian Records as well as enjoying some prominence on psycore labels such as Voodoo Hoodoo Records .
