Trance Metal

A fusion of Trance and Metal, it is typically characterized by a tempo between 130 and 160 BPM, played with keyboards and metal instrumentation, sung with harsh and aggressive vocals including many clean melodic styles, and regularly uses techniques and traits found in Melodic Death Metal, Symphonic Metal, and Electronic Dance Music. Important distinctions that separate trance metal from similar genres is that it's usually a melodic and uplifting or otherwise melancholy sound, that is absent of typical Electronicore and Metalcore vocals and their Pop music tendencies, as well as effects used in Industrial Metal and Cyber Metal.

Trance metal became better known and the sole genre of several artists in the mid 00s after trance music established a popular presence that a following of melodic death metal bands recognized. Notable trance metal bands include Blood Stain Child, Deadlock, Silent Descent, Timecry, Lost Eden, and Noidz.

Here's a song from PassCode's 2019 J-pop Trance Metal album Clarity. BABYMETAL was a somewhat similar band that also took from Trance Metal.
