Folk Pop

Folk pop is a genre originating from the 1950s which blends Pop music with Contemporary Folk. It has many similarities with Folk Rock of its era and many folk pop bands have been defined as such, as they both tend to use backing bands and pop structures. However, folk pop is characterized by a more commercial sound, with less reliance on electric guitar, a larger presence of harmonized and catchy melodies, and shorter, softer songs. The genre's popularity was at its largest from the mid 1960s to early 1970s, with the success of artists such as Simon & Garfunkel, Joni Mitchell, Donovan, and Cat Stevens.

Simon and Garfunkel's 1970 album Bridge Over Troubled Water is RYM's highest ranked 	   
Folk Pop album.

Here's the title track:

And here are three different covers of the song:  
Roberta Flack's, which might be my favorite. Very soulful and smooth. Incredible voice. From 1971\.

Aretha Franklin's. Also soulful but in a more upbeat southern soul direction, taking from Gospel and Electric Blues. From 1971\.

Jacob Collier's A cappella cover from 2024:

People often complain about Jacob Collier's maximalistic approach, which can feel like he just throws his talent and technical knowledge to the listener with no restraint. Regardless, he's got a unique, unmatched sound that I find consistently interesting to listen to.
