Shaabi is a type of music, dance and way of living that developed in Cairo during the early 1970s.

The word “shaabi” is an Egyptian Arabic term comparable to “ghetto”; it has come to describe the style of music popular in such neighbourhoods, a style more rough and playful than most Egyptian pop music. This style evolved from baladi, an Egyptian rhythm and dance, and mawwal, a sentimental form of Arabic vocal improvisation. Shaabi lyrics are often politically charged and irreverently humorous.

Moroccan Chaabi and Algerian Chaabi, while similarly named, are unrelated to Egyptian shaabi in sound and origin.
