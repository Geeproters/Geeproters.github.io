The 18th century for spanish classical music is considered a period of decline, music flourished again in the 19th century. Felip Pedrell, considered the father of Spanish musicology, published the manifesto "Por nuestra música" (For our music) which stated that “a culture must create its own style of music, incorporating national and folk song into art music”. The exchange of ideas with Pedrell was very influential on Isaac Albéniz and Enrique Granados, who both studied and wrote about Spanish music of the past, mainly from the Siglo de Oro, incorporating some forms and styles into their own music. Albéniz wrote Suite española, integrating the dances and rhythmic patterns associated with the folklore of several Spanish regions, whereas Iberia is considered his masterpiece due to the synthesis of Impressionism and Spanish Folk Music, including Chotis madrileño, seguidilla, Saeta, fandanguillo, Sevillanas, Spanish Habanera or jota.

As for Granados, he's also considered a nationalist composer, with works such as 12 Danzas españolas or Goyescas, blending current European Music trends with popular Flamenco, jota and parranda.

Enrique Granados' 12 Danzas españolas Op. 37 / H. 142, written 1888\.
