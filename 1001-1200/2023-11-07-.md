Hard trance

Hard trance is a form of Trance music characterized by the incorporation of trance structures and atmospheres into faster rhythms within a more intense, rave-oriented nature, initially emerging from the first wave of trance music of the early 1990s among producers in Western Europe (mainly from the Benelux and German areas). The developments of hard trance became rooted within earlier existing forms of trance music, Acid Trance in particular, with minor influences of popular underground dance music subgenres like Breakbeat Hardcore, Techno and New Beat. Most producers that worked for the Bonzai Records label near Antwerp, Belgium majorly contributed to the hard trance sound.

Hard trance of the 1990s commonly incorporates more thumping rhythms in contrast to earlier trance styles, often residing within a tempo range of 130-160 BPM, with melodic synth elements revolving around trance's lush pads and gated / plucked synths, 303 'acid' bass patterns and strong supersaw sections. Since the late 1990s this sound has moved to a more modern evolution, utilizing louder percussion and drawing in parallels to Tech Trance and Uplifting Trance, leading the genre to mimic both genres' structures whilst keeping its intense atmospheric traits.
