The bawu is a Chinese wind instrument. Although shaped like a flute, it is actually a free reed instrument, with a single metal reed. It is played in a transverse manner. It has a pure, clarinet-like timbre and its playing technique incorporates the use of much ornamentation, particularly bending tones.

The hulusi, also known as the cucurbit flute and the gourd flute, is a free reed wind instrument from China, Vietnam, and the Shan State, played also by the indigenous people of Assam

Here's an interesting album I came across making use of those instruments.  
巴乌与葫芦丝 (云南风情) or Bawu and Hulusi (Yunnan Style).

Here's a link to the youtube playlist. The first track is called 月光下的凤尾竹 (Phoenix tail bamboo in the moonlight)

Both instruments are often decorated with Chinese knots. In these attached images a Pan Chang knot appears to be used.

The Pan Chang Knot is one of the eight symbols of Buddhism. It communicates that religion's belief in a cycle of life with no beginning and no end. It was illustrated in a painting of the Emperor Xiaozhong that is now in the Palace Museum in Beijing.
