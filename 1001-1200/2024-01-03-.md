Here's Stan Getz & Jo√£o Gilberto's 1964 Bossa nova and Samba-jazz album Getz / Gilberto  
[https://youtu.be/Cxd4LKSecEM](https://youtu.be/Cxd4LKSecEM)

Stan Getz was known as "The Sound" because of his warm, lyrical tone, with his prime influence being the wispy, mellow timbre of his idol, Lester Young.

I've never been a found of that overly light, airy sound that Getz and Young share, but it's a beloved album (\#1 for 1964, \#275 overall on RYM and the highest ranked for both Bossa nova and Samba-jazz) and so worth mentioning at least once. I do like every aspect of the album aside from Getz' playing.
