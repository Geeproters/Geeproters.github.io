On RYM it's ranked \#6 for 1997, \#155 overall.

Great musicianship and fantastic instrumentation, philosophical, thought provovoking lyics, and great songwriting.

I'll go over a few traditional or semi-traditional American pop styles next. I learnt about these pretty extensively in MUSI1002, a music elective I took in my first year at Carleton, and a lot of the songs I'll rec were assigned listenings from that class.
