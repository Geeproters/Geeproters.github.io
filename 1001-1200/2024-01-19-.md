Psapp is a British experimental electronica band. The band, a duo consisting of Carim Clasmann and Galia Durant, are sometimes credited with inventing a musical style known as toytronica, a form of electronica made with toys and toy instruments. They are also noted for their use of found sounds and homemade instruments, including the meowing of live cats, a "mechanical chicken", and a xylophone-like instrument made of bones they call the "boneaphone". They have released five albums, a Japan Exclusive Mini-Album, Northdown, and five EPs.

Here's their single, Tricycle, from 2006

Psapp also composed the song "Cosy in the Rocket", the main theme on the medical-drama TV series Grey's Anatomy, for which they have received multiple BMI awards. Some of their other songs have been used in other American TV shows such as The OC and Nip/Tuck as well as the UK Channel 4 TV show Sugar Rush.
