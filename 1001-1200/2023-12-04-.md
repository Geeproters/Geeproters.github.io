2 exams left, but I just realized I missed an album from my long-time favorite trip hop/downtempo/art pop duo Elsiane.

A few tracks from their new self-titled album, released October 2023\. The first two here were released as singles a while ago.

This is a group I've been listening to since before high school. I talked a bit about them on the 4th rec, now nearly 3 years ago.

Elsiane is the group's 5th album in the 23 years since the start of their collaboration.
