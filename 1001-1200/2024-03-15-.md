"The Vision of Escaflowne" is a Japanese anime series that aired in 1996\. The soundtrack was composed by Japanese composer Yoko Kanno (best known for Cowboy Bebop, Terror in Resonance, Ghost in the Shell, and many other anime) with her spouse, cellist and composer Hajime Mizoguchi.

Yoko Kanno's style blends classical, jazz, and electronic elements, but her sound is distinctive. Her ability to evoke emotion and atmosphere through her music has solidified her status as one of the most beloved and influential composers in contemporary Japanese entertainment.

Her work on Escaflowne, which was early in her anime scoring career, is interesting to hear even if only to pick out the parts that would later be developed for the soundtracks of shows like Ghost in the Shell.

Here are a couple of tracks from the 2000 Escaflowne movie. These ones are by Midori Takada, Japanese composer and percussionist. She has been described as a pioneer of ambient and minimalist music
