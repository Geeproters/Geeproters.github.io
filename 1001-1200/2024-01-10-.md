Jun Togawa is a Japanese singer, musician and actress. She is one of the greatest influences on Japanese avant-garde music and media, and her career spans over 35 years. Her close friends over the years include Susumu Hirasawa (my favorite musician).

Here's her most well known song, Suki Suki Daisuki, from her 1985 album of the same name. In some ways meant to be a parody of idol music in Japan at the time. I've talked about this before, but Japan's idol industry first emerged in the 1960s and became prominent in the 1970s and 1980s due to television. During the 1980s, regarded as the "Golden Age of Idols", idols drew in commercial interest and began appearing in commercials and television dramas.

It can be difficult to find accurate translations for the lyrics of some of her songs. The video linked above is subtitled, so the slightly ominous nature of the subject matter isn't lost to english viewers.

Here's another track off the album I just like. Regarded as a cover of the Vera Lynn classic â€œIt Hurts to Say Goodbye" from 1967\.
