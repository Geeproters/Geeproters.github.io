I recced a favorite album of mine that happened to be by PilotRedSun on rec 37, but I didn't talk much about the artist.

Michael Epler, better known online as PilotRedSun (stylized as pilotredsun) and/or PilotRedSky, is an animator and electronic musician known for his avant-garde animation videos that intentionally lack context and use animation errors as a stylistic medium.

PilotRedSun's music, including his album I posted for rec 37, Achievement, has an incredible surreal and dreamlike quality. Listening to his music has always given me a peculiar sense of nostalgia even before I had an actual nostalgic attachment to it.

Pilotredsky is the music handle for PilotRedSun. I haven't been keeping up to date on what he's been making in the past couple years. But I'm planning on listening through his whole discography soon.
