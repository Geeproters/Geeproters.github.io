Orchestral Song

Orchestral Song is a form of composition that blends the vocal style and structure of Art Song with Orchestral arrangements. Like Lied, orchestral song typically falls into the genre of Romanticism, both in terms of sound and subject matter, but can differ widely in style and varies in scale from single songs to entire multi-movement song-cycles. In contrast to traditional art song, and due to its concert hall performance size, orchestral song also tends to be more overtly dramatic, tonally expressive, and demanding in its dynamic and interpretive range.

Composers have added orchestral backing to songs and arias at least since the Baroque Music period, but orchestral song began to take definitive shape in the mid-19th century with arrangements by Franz Liszt and especially with the publication of Hector Berlioz's song-cycle Les nuits d'été. The genre was further expanded in scope by late romantic composers such as Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss, and while it declined in popularity over the 20th century, orchestral song continued into the Modern Classical era with composers like Alban Berg, Benjamin Britten, and Dmitri Shostakovich all making notable contributions to the genre.

Orchestral song should not be confused with Opera, which is frequently tied to a dramatic narrative with stage production and features more complex interaction among multiple soloists. Orchestral song also shares characteristics with cantata and Oratorio, but unlike the latter two styles of vocal music, orchestral song is not frequently composed around a central religious text, program, or theme, rarely employs a full choir, and eschews compositional forms such as chorus & recitative.

Here's Symphony No. 3, composed by Henryk Mikołaj Górecki in 1976 and performed here by London Sinfonietta. Sung by the highly acclaimed Dawn Upshaw.
