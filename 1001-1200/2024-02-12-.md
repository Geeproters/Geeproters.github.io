Cha cha chá

I've described this one before, but here's an earlier track that I consider an interesting listen.

Enrique Jorrín's La Engañadora, first recorded by Orquesta América in March 1953

Chachachá is a style of ballroom dance music derived from Danzón. It was pioneered in 1951 by Enrique Jorrín with his famous composition "La engañadora", first released as a single in 1953 by Orquesta América, where Jorrín played the violin. This hit single launched the so-called "chachachá craze" replacing mambo as the leading ballroom dance throughout Cuba and, shortly after, the rest of the Americas. Like danzón and Mambo, chachachá has a 4/4 time signature, but it is slower and generally less complex than mambo. Its characteristic steady beat became the mainstay of popular Cuban Charangas such as Orquesta Aragón, Fajardo y Sus Estrellas and Orquesta América del 55, which kept the style in vogue until the early 1960s, when the Pachanga craze exploded
