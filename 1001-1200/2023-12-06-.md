Masanobu Hiraoka is an animator with and interesting style using never-ending morphing FX. He's got an incredible eye for texture. He's been featred several times of Adult Swim, and has worked on projects like Little Witch Academia and Chainsaw Man (both shows had endings animated by him), and with artists like Flying Lotus and Anderson .Paak.

Here's a Music Anime Douga by Banana.mp4 compiling some snippets of his animation across various projects.
