Cuban Charanga

Charanga is type a dance music played by traditional Cuban ensembles, influenced by Son cubano but performed on European instruments such as piano, bass, violins, and flutes. Charanga is often confused with the similar style of Pachanga. Charanga is more traditional and refers to orchestras while pachanga is more Western dance music-oriented.
