Suriname is a small country on the northeastern coast of South America. It's defined by vast swaths of tropical rainforest, Dutch colonial architecture and a melting-pot culture

Kawina originated around the 1860s, after the abolition of slavery. The vocals are typically call-and-response, and it is accompanied by all kinds of typical Surinamese percussion, such as the skratji.

Like many South American music genres, the rhythm of the kawina originates in Africa. African slaves took their music with them to Suriname. Where it became a dance. Originally the lyrics were religious.

After abolition of slavery, it became entertainment music, with lyrics that are more socially critical in tone.
