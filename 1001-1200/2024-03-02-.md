Here's his 1997 Shibuya-kei, Neo-Psychedelia, Indietronica album Fantasma.

Very eclectic and unique album. Its an immersive experience that blends fun digital production and sound effects with vocals and melodies with a leftfield vibe. Influenced by a vast and diverse assortment of music. Every track is different and creative and the whole record is packed with beautiful production and nice quirky vibes.

I am a fan, but it did take me a couple listens to digest it, with how disconnected the tracks can feel.

Track 3, 4, and 8 are my favorites.  
track 10 at 34:35 makes me smile hearing Fugue in G minor as a remix. Very goofy.
