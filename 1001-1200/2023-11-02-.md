Zamacueca is a traditional genre and dance that originated in the Black community of 19th century coastal Peru. It is a courtship dance in which partners flirted with each other while surrounded by a crowd of onlookers who sang, played instruments, clapped, and shouted words of encouragement. Zamacueca is sung in the minor mode and musically accompanied by a varying combination of guitar, vihuela, harp and cajón.

The dance gained a great deal of popularity during the early nineteenth century, thereafter developing a number of variants that were practiced by Criollo-Mestizo populations not only in Peru but also other parts of Latin America. Throughout the Spanish American wars of independence, as each republic broke off and formed its own identity, these adaptations were given status of national dance and changed the dance’s name over time (such as Zamba in Argentina, Cueca in Bolivia and Chile, and Marinera in Peru).

Nuevo Cancionero, also known as Movimiento del Nuevo Cancionero (New Songbook Movement), was a musical-literary movement in Argentina that aimed to reevaluate and reinvigorate “la música popular nativa” and to be the voice of poor and marginalized Argentines. Nuevo cancionero set lyrics denouncing social injustice and oppression to the characteristic rhythms of Latin America such as Zamba, Milonga, Chacarera, Cueca, and Guajira.

The movement was launched in Mendoza in 1963, when a group of poets and musicians published the Manifiesto fundacional del Movimiento del Nuevo Cancionero, articulating their position in favor of the defense of freedom of expression and formulating the basis for the renovation of popular music.

Here are a couple tracks from Atahualpa Yupanqui's 1955 album Camino del indio, belonging to the genres of Zamba and Nuevo Cancionero
