My top songs from my wrapped. Some mild tonal whiplash from SCARING THE HOES but besides that its pretty consistent \- relaxing instrumental and ambient music.

If I were to pick a singular favorite song I listened to for the first time this year (so no Kagayaki from rec 600 nor Blue Room from rec 330), then it's gotta be Arnold Schoenberg's 1899 early expressionism string sextet in one movement, Verkl√§rte Nacht.  
I talked about it on rec 789 back in february. I find it very moving, particularly this recording by the Emerson String Quartet.

It is orchestrally rich and constantly moving. Its beautiful and sweet phrases are in stark contrast to Schoenberg's atonal work, but they make for an enjoyable listen I can and do keep coming back to.
