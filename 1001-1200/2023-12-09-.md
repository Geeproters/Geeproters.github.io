Chamber jazz is Jazz made by mostly small acoustic-based ensembles with emphasized improvisation and influenced by Neoclassicism and Traditional Folk Music. It is often influenced by the classical music of non-Western cultures, mainly South Asian Classical Music, Persian Classical Music, and East Asian Classical Music. It is sometimes seen as Third Stream that takes a more pared-down approach, eschewing that genre's orchestral elements and opting instead for ensembles resembling those used in Chamber Music.

Here's The Colours of ChloÃ«, a 1974 chamber jazz album by Eberhard Weber.v
