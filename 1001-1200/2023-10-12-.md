Flamenco is a traditional music style from Spain. It is primarily music for vocals and acoustic guitar, but is also often accompanied by traditional percussion. In its present form flamenco guitarists and singers are often accompanied by modern instrumentation such as piano, bass guitar and wind instruments.

Flamenco music is based on the highly typical phrygian or dorian scales which lends it its characteristic melancholia. The singing can be especially emotional, while the guitar playing is characterized by fiery rhythms, often used to accompany traditional flamenco dances.

Flamenco subgenres are called "palos," with Tangos and Rumbas possibly being the most well-known of these.

Francisco Sánchez Gómez, known as Paco de Lucía, was a Spanish virtuoso flamenco guitarist, composer, and record producer. Here's one of his Flamenco/Rumba flamenca tracks, originally released 1976\.

In Cuba, the rumba is performed with multiple percussion instruments, playing in duple meter. The flamenco version of it uses palmas, guitar, and golpes (slapping the guitar). In addition, rumba flamenca has a particular guitar strumming pattern absent in other flamenco styles.

The compilation of his music that I found this track on, Integral, consists of 27 albums or 256 songs, and is about 14 hours long.
