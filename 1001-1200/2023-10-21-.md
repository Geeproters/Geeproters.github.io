The term Polka represents both a musical style and its corresponding dance. Its origin is traced to Central and Eastern Europe, and more specifically to the Bohemian region of what is now the Czech Republic during the mid-1800s, and was brought to North America by immigrants from the region. Polka features are a lively beat played in 2/4 time, with the instruments (including the accordion, fiddle, clarinet, trumpet, concertina, tuba and a rhythm section) chosen based on which of the several regional variants of Polka is being performed. Polka is also featured in some Romanticism Music. The style remains very popular in its areas of origin, as well as the Midwestern United States of America.

Brave Combo is a polka/rock/worldbeat band based in Denton, Texas. Founded in 1979 by guitarist/keyboardist/accordionist Carl Finch, they have been a prominent fixture in the Texas music scene for more than thirty-five years. Some have described their music as "New Wave Polka," hecause their music, both originals and covers, incorporate a number of dance styles besides polka including Latin American and Caribbean styles like norte√±o, salsa, rumba, cha-cha-cha, choro, samba, two-step, cumbia, charanga, merengue, ska, etc, as well as other genres.

As part of their perceived artistic mission to expand the musical tastes of their listeners, they have often played and recorded covers of well-known songs in a style radically different from the original versions. Examples include polka versions of Jimi Hendrix's "Purple Haze"
