Gnawa

A mixture of Sub-Saharan African, Arabic and Amazigh Music, created by the Gnawa, an ethnic minority group in North Africa, mainly Morocco. As descendants of black slaves and traders who lived in North Africa in Medieval times and converted to Islam, their music has influence from both the ritualistic drumming of West Africa and the sacred singing of Arabic cultures. The most famous modern performer is Maleem Mahmoud Ghania, who has collaborated with several famous Western Jazz musicians.

Here's Maleem Mahmoud Ghania and Pharoah Sanders' 1994 album The Trance of Seven Colors
