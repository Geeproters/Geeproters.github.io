Música gaúcha refers to a popular music style of southern Brazil, based on the traditional polka and other European rhythms. The lyrics mostly deal with the "gaucho" native lifestyle in the Pampas. Gauchos are known as traditional cowboys born and raised in regions across Southern Brazil where they formed a culture and way of life that is truly unique. It is traditionally played on the accordion.

Nowadays a distinction can be made between traditional and popular música gaúcha. The traditional variant is represented by musicians such as Renato Borghetti, Yamandu Costa, Jayme Caetano Braun, Gaúcho da Fronteira and Luiz Marenco. The popular variant, which sometimes features instruments like electric guitars and is generally more youth-oriented includes bands such as Os Monarcas and Tchê Garotos.

Here's one such track from Gaita Ponto, a 1984 album by Ranato Borghetti
