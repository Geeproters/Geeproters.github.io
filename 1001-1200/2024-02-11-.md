Pachanga

Pachanga originated in Cuba in the late 1950s. Eduardo Davidson and José Fajardo are credited as the fathers of the genre, which is a combination of Merengue, Conga, Rumba cubana and Cumbia, and is closely related to Boogaloo. In the early 1960s the genre was particularly popular in Latin New York. The style is fast, festive, and playful.

Nowadays the genre is also used to describe the more commercial forms of Latin dance music. In Spain the term is used to describe tacky, 'populist', ultra-catchy and simple music with very monotonous rhythms and silly, tasteless, cheap or racy 'singalong' lyrics. The term is often used in a derogatory way, like the lowest form of Bubblegum music applied to Hispanic Music. This kind of music is played mainly in popular celebrations (fiestas) and town festivals (verbenas).

Pachanga should not be confused with Cuban Charanga, a traditional orchestral style lighter than Danzón. Nonetheless, due to the evolution of charanga during the 1970s and 1980s both terms are frequently used interchangeably when referring to both pachanga and modern charanga, which is no longer based on the traditional danzón.

Here's a track from Mon Rivera y su Orquesta's 1963 album Qué gente averiguá
