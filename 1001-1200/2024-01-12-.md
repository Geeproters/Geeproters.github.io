Mica Levi, also known by their stage name Micachu, is an English singer, songwriter, composer and producer. Levi is classically trained and since 2008 has released experimental pop music with their band Good Sad Happy Bad, including the critically praised debut album Jewellery in 2009\. Their work can primarily be described as Indie/Art/Noise Pop.

Here are a couple tracks I like from their 2009 album Jewellery.

Quirky and energetic. Some of the songs are more raw feeling than others, but as a whole the album is very polished.
