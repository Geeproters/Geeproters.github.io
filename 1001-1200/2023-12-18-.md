In the second half of the 20th century, Andrés Segovia popularized classical guitar music following mainly the Spanish romantic-modern and nationalist style, whereas Narciso Yepes also integrated popular forms into classical guitar playing. Several contemporary guitarists perform folkloric and classical flamenco, for instance, Pepe Romero, Paco Peña, Manolo Sanlúcar, Celedonio Romero or Paco de Lucía. In comparison to folkloric flamenco, classical flamenco has more sustained notes, a softer sound and is more academic with little to no presence of improvisation; the Spanish or flamenco guitar is commonly replaced by the classical guitar.
