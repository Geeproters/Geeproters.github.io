Morna is the most popular Cape Verdean Music genre, and thanks to the success of artists such as Cesária Évora, the queen of morna, it is considered the national music of Cape Verde. Morna is typically sung in Cape Verdean creole, and it is characterized by a slow tempo, monotonality and the use of the violão. It is a form a form of folk music usually sung in the Cape Verdean Creole, accompanied by clarinet, violin, guitar and cavaquinho.

The origins of morna can be traced back to the 18th century, when it appeared due to the combination and evolution of several traditional folk styles. It is popularly thought that this happened in the Boa Vista Island. In the early 20th century, poet Eugénio Tavares composed mornas with a romantic and dramatic style, which is still prevalent today. Morna continued to evolve throughout the 20th century, and by the 1960s an electric version of morna had become increasingly successful, as well as a lighter and faster style called Coladeira. In the 2010s, traditional morna coexists with other fusion styles. Even though Cesária Évora passed away in 2011, morna continues to be very popular due to artists such as Dany Silva and Karin Mensah.
