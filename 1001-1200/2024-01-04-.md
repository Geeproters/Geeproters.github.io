Twerk, or 100 BPM, is a subgenre of Trap \[EDM\] that draws influence from Bounce and Miami Bass. The genre's name comes from the eponymous dance style which developed in New Orleans with great connection to bounce music.

Instead of the half-time bass drops of trap, it has a more energetic, fast-paced tempo and rhythm, usually around 100 BPM. Bounce beats, samples, and vocals can be found in the genre, especially early into its evolution, but as the genre evolved it grew more influenced by mainstream styles and trends within the EDM scene. Vocals in twerk songs usually come from short samples or live MCs, with lyrics often sexual or party-oriented in nature.

Twerk originated in the early 2010s, soon after trap, with artists like Brillz and TWRK experimenting in the genre. It reached peak mainstream popularity shortly afterward, with songs such as DJ Snake's "Turn Down for What" and "Get Low," and Diplo's "Express Yourself" gaining mainstream attention. Though most of the artists in the genre moved on from the sound in the mid-2010s, twerk's influence remains in mainstream EDM today.
