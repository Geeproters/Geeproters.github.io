Maytree (메이트리) is a South Korean five-member a cappella group formed back in 2000\.

Beginning in 2021, the group began releasing a series of YouTube videos covering sound effects used in computer and mobile phone systems. The first video, released in January 2021, covered Windows sound effects. Others followed, including sound effects for iPhones and Samsung Galaxy phones, as well as the Angry Birds and other video games. The group then released covers of the introductory music for various major film distributors as well as others such as the music for the UEFA Champions League. These covers have generated a significant amount of attention. On October 1, 2021 at the height of the explosion of popularity of the South Korean show Squid Game, which became Netflix's most popular ever series, Maytree released covers of some of the main themes from the show. That video has now amassed 281 million vies on youtube
