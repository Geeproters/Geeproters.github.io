Uplifting trance

Uplifting trance is a style of Trance music that evolved from Progressive Trance and Dream Trance. The style is distinguished from progressive trance through a bigger emphasis on melody and a more frequent use of buildup-breakdown-an them structures, as well as more prominent drums influenced by Hard Trance. Typically uplifting trance ranges from 135-142 BPM, though slower examples can be found as well. Common is the so-called supersaw, a sound created on the Roland JP8000 synth (first produced in 1996), first used by Ferry Corsten on singles such as "Don't Be Afraid (Of the Power)" and "Out of the Blue".

Uplifting trance became one of the most successful trance subgenres, exploding in popularity towards the late 1990s and into the early 2000s \- especially in the UK, where many uplifting trance singles hit the top 10 of the singles chart, such as Rank 1's "Airwave" and the Ferry Corsten remix of "Barber's Adagio for Strings".

Its growth was also paired with rise of superstar DJs, who toured around the world, produced, and ran their own labels, such as Ferry Corsten, TiÃ«sto, and Armin van Buuren. Since many of the most prominent artists are from the Netherlands, uplifting trance was also nicknamed "Dutch trance".

Despite the backlash that uplifting trance got after 2001 due to its oversaturation in the market and in clubs, it continued to be one of the most popular trance subgenres, played on big festivals such as Sensation and Tomorrowland. The rise of the Internet also helped the genre gain new fans around the world, as Armin van Buuren's radio show (airing weekly on Dutch ID\&T radio since 2001\) quickly reached an audience outside the home country with an estimated 40 million listeners and set the template for other trance radio shows.
