Grebo (AKA Fraggle) is a term coined by the music newspapers Melody Maker and NME and refers to a short-lived musical style and subculture centered around the English Midlands in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The musically diverse bands in this genre shared a cultural mindset and approach to music-making: distilling (or perhaps re-appropriating) everything around them into a generalized sound reflecting the British zeitgeist at a time of great societal change.

Much like the Baggy groups in the north of England who mixed several seemingly disparate musical elements with Alternative Dance, grebo musicians such as Pop Will Eat Itself, Jesus Jones and Carter the Unstoppable Sex Machine (the latter two were actually from London, but identified with the grebo subculture) did the same, mixing genres such as Noise Pop, Hip Hop, Indie Pop, Industrial Rock, Plunderphonics, and Punk Rock. The resulting sound was a raw, futuristic, sample-heavy form of alternative dance with a grungy guitar sound that signaled the end of the Cold War and the beginning of the Information Age, a topic which appeared commonly in their lyrics.

Here's 101 Damnations by Carter the Unstoppable Sex Machine, released 1990\.

The hymn at the start is called Love Divine, All Loves Excelling:

"Finish then Thy new creation  
Pure and spotless let us be  
Let us see Thy great salvation  
Perfectly restored in Thee  
Changed from glory into glory  
Till in heaven we take our place  
Till we cast our crowns before Thee  
Lost in wonder love and praise"
