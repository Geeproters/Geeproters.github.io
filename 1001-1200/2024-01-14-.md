French electro, a subgenre of Electro House, emerged in the early 2000s, led by artists like Justice, SebastiAn, and Vitalic from the Ed Banger Records label. It blends electro house with elements of Electroclash, Nu-Disco, Synth Funk, and Electro-Industrial. Distinct from French House, it features harsher percussion, basslines, and distorted leads, sometimes incorporating Rock-inspired elements. Unlike French house, it lacks heavy use of filters and sampling but embraced synth funk and disco influences, and occasional retro elements like talkboxes. French electro varies in BPM, spanning 110 to 140\.

With certain early examples going back to Daft Punk's late 1990s work, notably the song Rollin' & Scratchin' with its relentless midtempo beat and harsh synths, the genre properly emerged in the early and mid-2000s with Justice, Boys Noize, Digitalism, Teenage Bad Girl, and Mr. Oizo. Justice achieved mainstream success during the Bloghouse era and New Rave. While later electro house styles like Fidget House gained prominence, French electro continued influencing underground Electronic Dance Music in the 2010s and genres like Midtempo Bass, Synthwave (especially Darksynth), and Porter Robinson's Electropop.
