Yes, I have done Kevin Penkin several times in the past, but in my defense, I haven't done a rec on Made in Abyss since rec 197\.

Here are a few tracks from the soundtrack of the newest season that came out last year. I'm finally getting around to watching it.

Here's a darker sounding track:

These three are more uplifting. There's an interesting mix of old and new MiA sounds in a couple of them:

Also interesting:  
https://youtu.be/uvUxKOhaEHQ (as with his some of his previous scores for the show, this song uses a made-up language, but it seems to be a different one from that of Hanezeve Caradhina)

What a wildly uncomfortable but also pretty incredible show. I have to mentally prepare my rom-com slice-of-life rotted brain before watching each ep. There's a lot to dissect and digest.

Kevin Penkin the GOAT as always, of course. For this season he continues with his staple style of mixing electronic and acoustic elements together. He's added a few other sounds and motifs this time around, though, including a more natural-sounding piano, some dark sounding synths, distorted vocals, and some atypical sounds and instruments he hasn't often used before, if at all (the tabla on VS. ORGANIC MACHINE and MARKET OF IRUBURU may be my favorite new addition). He also uses fewer traditional orchestral instruments/sections. Particularly absent are the strings and woodwinds.

It sounds fresh, but it hasn't lost that novel, hauntingly beautiful alien feel that I love about it. In fact, many of the tracks sound more alien than anything that came before. The music fits the 6th layer of the Abyss that the season takes place in perfectly.

Many of the tracks play off of previous ones from the movie or first season. It's very rewarding the hear them after such a long time, and the sense of vague familiarity is interesting and hard to describe.
