Al jeel is a style of Arabic Pop that first emerged in the 1970s, as an alternative to Shaabi. Al jeel takes influences from foreign Pop music and uses rhythms that resemble those of Reggae, but still has a distinctly Egyptian sound. The danceable beat of al jeel is generally produced by a drum machine, but the genre also makes use of traditional Arabic instrumentation. One of the most famous al jeel performers is حميد الشاعري \[Hamid El Shaeri\].

Here's a short track from علاء عبد الخالق \[Ala' Abdel Khaleq\]'s 1987 album وياكى

Industrial rock is a hybrid of Rock and various Post-Industrial styles, though Post-Industrial itself already describes genres that combine the aesthetic of early Industrial music with more accessible genres. Common musical characteristics include heavily distorted, abrasive guitars, percussion and vocals. The genre also employs keyboards, synthesizers, drum machines, and samplers. The genre developed in the 1980s, but was brought to mainstream attention in the 1990s with artists such as Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson.
