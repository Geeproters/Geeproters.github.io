Full-On (or Full-On Psytrance)

Full-On is a faster and more intense form of Psytrance usually around 145-150 BPM using harder basslines, regular vocal samples and "spacey" effects. Well-known artists in the sub-genre include 1200 Micrograms, Growling Mad Scientists, Astrix, Infected Mushroom and Talamasca.

Here's Infected Mushroom's 2007 album Vicious Delicious.

I'm not a big fan of them these days, but Infected Mushroom was one of the bands that got me "into" listening to music. Becoming Insane, Change The Formality, and Heavyweight are all songs off this album that I used to be able to listen to non-stop.

Their music is also often described as Trance Metal
