Chamamé is a genre originating in northeast Argentina, being particularly associated with the Corrientes province. It has spread abroad to Uruguay, Paraguay and southern Brazil. The genre mixes native Guaraní music with the neighbouring style of Paraguayan Polka and forms of European music, particularly schottische. It was originally sung mostly in the Guaraní language, whilst today it is common for lyrics to be in Yopará dialect, a fusion of Spanish and Guaraní. Many singers of Música gaúcha also play chamamé, and it is also said to reflect the gaúcho style of life. The genre was inscribed as a UNESCO intangible cultural heritage of humanity in 2020\.
