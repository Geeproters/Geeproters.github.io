NRG

NRG is a Trance style that emerged from UK Hard House in the second half of the 1990s and became popular with the rave scene. The genre's name was established by the offbeat bass patterns that were inspired from Hi-NRG (see rec 697), which were added over darker and more anthemic trance beats and synths mostly on the 155-165 BPM range, mostly lacking the strong presence of uplifting melodies to give a more rhythmic atmosphere. The genre still follows the traditional trance structure but the atmosphere is cleaner and more minimalistic than Hard Trance.
