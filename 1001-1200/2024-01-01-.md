Here's an album from November 2023, The Rime of Memory by Panopticon.

I've done Atmospheric Black Metal twice in the past (602 and 996), but I thought it was worth it to do it again now since it's a pretty interesting and well made album. It mixes Atmospheric Black Metal with an Americana sound, which, while not a new idea, is something they manage quite well. I'm not a big fan of the death-metal leaning vocals, but I find that there's still a lot to enjoy within the album even for those not too into the more extreme metal subgenres.
