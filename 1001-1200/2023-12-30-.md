Fidget House

Fidget House is a style of Electro House that distinguishes itself by making heavy use of Breakbeat Hardcore-esque synth stabs, pitch bending of basslines, and cut-up vocal samples, as well as glitchy, or "choppy", 4/4 rhythms. It first developed in the late 2000s and takes influence from other contemporary styles, including Bassline and UK Garage. The most well-known Fidget House producers include Herv√© and Crookers.

Not a big fan of the genre. Sounds dated to me.

That was like 11 recs of house. I've heard enough for now so I'll move on
