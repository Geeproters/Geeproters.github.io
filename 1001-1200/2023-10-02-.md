Emir KobiliÄ‡, known professionally as Salvatore Ganacci, is a Bosnian-Swedish DJ and record producer. His performances at Tomorrowland in 2018 and 2019 became viral, as did the music video for his song "Horse".

His other videos, most often directed by Vedran Rupic, have subsequently become very popular as well. They are generally bizarre or humorous, and are typically visually striking.

This one's very different from his rest. Animated by Truba Animation and directed by Will Goodfellow.
