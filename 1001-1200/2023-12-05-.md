I didn't listen to much vocaloid this year but here are a few tracks I enjoyed

[https://youtu.be/2YjKVSjdDVM](https://youtu.be/2YjKVSjdDVM) (Released a few months ago. Not the style I'd expect for a song using GUMI. Nice usage of an egyptian-sounding pentatonic scale)

[https://youtu.be/8JXiXt0D6tw](https://youtu.be/8JXiXt0D6tw) (Released a year ago. Azari is a VOCALOID producer who tends to post their music with blank titles on YouTube and Niconico Douga, but recently they started titling their songs)

[https://youtu.be/Ve6kXYwRAL0](https://youtu.be/Ve6kXYwRAL0) (this ones older, from 2015\. It's a vocaloid remix of Big Brother by Susumu Hirasawa. This version features flower, which has a nice neutral androgynous voice designed to specialize in rock music)
