Here's a recent album I happened to stumble upon.

A Lonely Sinner, by samlrc. Released 2024 (a few days ago)

Lovely Lo-fi Slacker/Post-Rock atmosphere that plays with a few other genres. Occasionally pastoral with some nice dense electronic elements. Lots of standout tracks and sections and a nice overall story arc. My favorite tracks are Philautia, Storge, For M., and The Beauty Of The Present Moment, but the whole album is worth a listen, start to finish.
