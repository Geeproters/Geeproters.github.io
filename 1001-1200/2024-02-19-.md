Since I'm on Electronic music; I think it's surprising that I haven't talked about Boards of Canada in 1159 days of doing this. Like Bjork, their music is right up my alley (IDM, Downtempo) but I put off listening to until just a couple of years ago.

Here's their 1998 album Music Has the Right to Children.

Atmospheric, mellow, somethimes mysterious and surreal. And nostalgic.

It's an intricate and evocative album that resonates very differently with its listeners. Depending on how one hears it, it can evoke warmth or cold. It can sound bittersweet, soothing, lush, or metalic, or maybe all at once.
