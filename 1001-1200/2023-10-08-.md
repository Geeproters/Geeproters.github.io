Javelin is a recent album by Sufjan Stevens (who I mentioned on recs 958 and 394), released 6 October 2023\. The album belongs to the genres of Indie Folk, Singer-Songwriter, and Chamber Folk. It blends folk melodies on acoustic instrumemts with electronic elements, and thus could also be described as folktronica. The album is currently ranked \#1 on RYM for 2023, reaffirming Stevens' status as one of the finest contemporary singer-songwriters to singer-songwrite.

It's a lovely and warm listen with an intricate and intimate atmosphere. The release of the album coincides with Steven's recovery from his diagnosis from a serious autoimmune disease. The album is dedicated to his late partner. It also serves as a return-to-roots of sorts for Stevens after a few years of ambient music and ballets.

As I've mentioned several times in the past, I've always been a sucker for meticulous, intricate production and especially production that blends electronic and acoustic elements. Due to its bittersweet and sentimental atmosphere and themes exploring love, loss, and self-discovery, its a good album for autumn and one I'll be listening through again soon.
