Remain Calm is a 2016 album by Mica Levi & Oliver Coates. It belongs to the genres of Electroacoustic and Post-Minimalism, and makes use of techniques commonly incorporated into Ambient, Glitch, Sound Collage, and Chamber Music.

It's exactly the kind of electroacoustic that I like.

Chaotic, ethereal, and somewhere mysterious between mechanical and psychedelic.

I like the whole album, but I wish some of the songs were a little longer. The album comes out to about 28 minutes. In form, the 13 tracks (most under three minutes long), resemble sketches. This arguably leaves it feeling "unfinished" but I believe that's an important aspect of its method of delivery. It's not a difficult listen, and in fact it's one of the more refreshing electroacoustic and post-minimalistic works I've listened through. Something I'll come back to in the future at least a few times, I think.

The cellist, Oliver Coates, was a contributor to Radioheadâ€™s A Moon Shaped Pool. I might talk about Mica Levi next rec
