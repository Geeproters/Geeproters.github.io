Batuque is believed to be the oldest style of music from the Cape Verde islands, believed to have once been spread across the archipelago, but now limited to Santiago. It was also common in Brazil in 19th century.

Traditional batuque is unusual due to its lack of polyphonic singing and its usage of polyrhythms. Traditionally, batuque was organized into two distinct movements, the first being the call-and-response galion, and the second being the txabéta, which is analogous to an orchestral climax.

I've timestamped a traditional batuque from this compilation, Música popular do Norte 4, released 1976

More recent composers, working after Cape Verde's independence from Portugal, have changed the form of their batuques, using polyphony and elements taken from other Cape Verdean genres such as the popular Morna and the upbeat Funaná.

Here are two songs from Mayra Andrade's 2009 album Stória, stória...
