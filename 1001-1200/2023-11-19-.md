Ibiza Trance

Ibiza trance is a subgenre of Trance which has evolved from Balearic Beat (mentioned on rec 414). The earliest Ibiza trance compositions date back to the 1990s, a few years after the emergence of Balearic beat. It keeps the same "Balearic" flavor like Balearic beat, although it is characterized by a higher rate of heavy pulses in the range of 125-145 BPM, usually around 130 BPM. Being based in Spain, it usually expresses a Latin feel and a relaxing atmosphere, which makes this genre similar in many regards to Dream Trance.
