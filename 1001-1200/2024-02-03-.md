Here's a genre strongly identified by the style of Brill Building pop songwriters such as Goffin & King and Barry & Greenwich and innovative producers such as Phil Spector.

Girl Group is a genre of Pop music that combines elements of Rhythm & Blues, Rock & Roll, and Traditional Pop music, and is typically performed by trios or quartets of female vocalists. The style is typified by a lead singer accompanied by loose backing harmonies. The last rec falls into this category as well, but the genres are distinct.

Girl Group originated with late 1950s Doo-Wop groups such as The Bobbettes and The Chantels, and was popularized in the early to mid 1960s by groups such as The Shirelles, The Crystals, The Ronettes, and The Shangri-Las.

This synergy of popular styles was a strong influence on the songwriting and production of influential artists such as The Beatles and The Beach Boys.
