Barber beats, an offshoot of the Vaporwave and Vapor movement, emerged in the mid-to-late-2010s, drawing influences from Downtempo, Trip Hop, Instrumental Hip Hop, and Nu Jazz. Unlike some vapor trends, it offers a less ironic take on the vaporwave ethos. Departing from the reverb-heavy sound of Dreampunk and early vaporwave, Barber beats features organic-sounding landscapes with live instrumentation and New Age-inspired "tribal" elements. Producers aim to recreate a 1990s atmosphere, resembling underground Chillout music. Elements of genres like Atmospheric Drum and Bass, Ambient House, and Progressive Breaks are occasionally present as well

Coined by Aloe City Wrld for Haircuts for Men's downtempo style, the term barber beats gained popularity, adopted by artists like Macroblank, ROMBREAKER, Modest by Default, and others. Despite its growth, the genre faced some criticism in the vaporwave scene for producers' heavily relying on remixing existing music, especially older vaporwave tracks. Barber beats has a distinct visual style inspired by "Acid Graphics," featuring lavish covers with mythological figures, often edited classical sculptures, and vinyl-inspired design. Some artists incorporate other elements, such as DΛRKNΣSS's manga-inspired covers. Many artists use Japanese characters in addition to or entirely in place of Latin characters. Though independent of Lo-Fi Hip Hop/chillhop, Barber beats is occasionally mixed with these genres due to their sonic similarities.

Each of these three artists have their own style of barber beats.I haven't listened through these albums fully, but I have listened to and enjoyed each of their works.

Relaxing stuff. Barber beats albums emulate lots of diverse moods, often more mysterious, ominous, or sensual.

The three albums linked above maybe be on the less uplifting side of barber beats. Haircuts for Men has now released 45 albums since 2014, and I know some of them are a lot more warm or mellow than others.
