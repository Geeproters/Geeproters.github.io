French House

French House is House music characterized by the use of filtered (low-pass, phaser, cut-off, etc.) Funk and Disco samples. Bass lines are often funky and heavy, and vocals often soulful and vocoded.

The genre rose to prominence with Daft Punk's debut album Homework as well as the single Music Sounds Better With You by Stardust. French House was a large part of the French Touch scene, the wave of critically-acclaimed French Electronic producers (including the aforementioned Daft Punk as well as AIR, Bob Sinclar, Dimitri From Paris, and St Germain) in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Due to their success the French Touch scene, despite being very varied, has become eponymous with French House.

Daft Punk's 2001 album Discovery (which ranks \#3 for 2001, \#71 overall on RYM) and their 1997 album Homework are the best known French House albums by far.

Instead, here's a 1998 album, Synthèse by Pépé Bradock.

Danceable for sure.
