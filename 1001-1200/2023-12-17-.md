The aforementioned composers were precursors of a nationalistic music movement, alike to Neoclassicism, known as neocasticismo at the beginning of the 20th century, which was characterized for its cultural, linguistic and even lineage purity pursuit freeing music of foreign influence. Its most important figures is Manuel de Falla, which blended Spanish folklore, mainly flamenco, with Modern Classical in works like El amor brujo \[Love the Magician\] and Siete canciónes populares españolas. Other examples are Joaquín Turina or Francisco Tárrega, who pioneered the blend of folk-based guitar music with classical forms. Joaquín Rodrigo's Concierto de Aranjuez is considered one of the best exponents of the genre due to its references to Spanish dances and rhythms and the influence of flamenco and fandango. Zarzuela also flourished again, with a strong influence of regional Madrid's casticismo, thanks to, among others, Federico Chueca, Francisco Asenjo Barbieri and Ruperto Chapí.
