I've used the word Glitch to describe music and genres several times in the past, but here's an actual description of Glitch as a genre.

Glitch is a style of experimental Electronic music that uses the sounds created by malfunctioning digital technology \- bugs, crashes, system errors, hardware noise, CD skipping, and digital distortion \- as main technique of composition. This unusual method of musical creation arguably began in Germany in the early 90s, with artists like Oval combining the technique with Ambient music to help cement its place in modern electronic music history. At the other end of the Glitch spectrum, Japanese musician 刀根康尚 \[Yasunao Tone\]'s use of damaged CDs created dense, extreme walls of sound, with Solo for Wounded CD perhaps being the best example. Modern glitch tends to use software to recreate these sounds, as opposed to genuinely defecting technology, and this increased ease of creation has resulted in the genre spreading out into other areas, such as Glitch Pop and Glitch Hop.

From Sora's 2003 album re.sort. Very accessible glitch album. Soft, warm, and peaceful.

From Autechre's 2016 album elseq 4\. This one may be less accessible. It's mechanical, cold, and surreal.
