Oriki (praise song) is a genre of sung poetry of Egba and Ekiti origin, is often considered the oldest Yoruba musical tradition. Other Yoruba vocal traditions include Ijala (hunter chants) and Odu (Ifa worship songs).

Some religious Yoruba music relies on drums to emulate the Yoruba language due to its tonality. Sacred Yoruba music has rarely been recorded in Nigeria, a notable exception being Drums of the Yoruba of Nigeria, released 1956\.

This collection of Nigerian drum music demonstrates the rich textures of the three-legged sacred Igbin drums which one plays with hands and sticks, the Dundun or pressure drum which plays not only rhythm but melody, and the two-toned Bata drums which are unique to the Yoruba people.

Some more interesting info; unlike other sacred Yoruba music, Afro-Cuban Yoruba rituals have been recorded profusely. Yoruba music in Cuba is part of the Santería (Lucumí) religion, maintaining the same characteristics that were brought by slaves during the 17th and 18th centuries.
