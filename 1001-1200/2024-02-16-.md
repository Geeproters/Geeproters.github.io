Berlin School is a genre named after its origin in 1970s Berlin and closely associated with Krautrock, was pioneered by Progressive Electronic artists like Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze, and Ashra. Its hallmark lies in the intricate evolution of multi-layered sequencer textures, ranging from atmospheric to hypnotic, often sidelining percussion-based rhythms. Analog synthesizers and distinct lead melodies are key features that set it apart from more rhythm-focused forms of Ambient music, although the boundary between them remains fluid.

Here's Klaus Schulze's "X", an album from 1978

Really nice. Deeply evocative, ominous, suspenseful. It's futuristic and fantastic and something about it hits just right for me.
