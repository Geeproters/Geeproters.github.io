Progressive Trance

Progressive trance emerged in the 1990s, in Western European countries, from the combination of Trance and Progressive House. It has a lower average bpm than typical trance (around 130 bpm instead of 140-160 bpm) and a recurrent melodic structure, which uses Tribal House and Breakbeat sounds. Progressive trance became very popular on the world's dance floors by the end of the millennium and it was played by very popular DJs like Sasha, Paul van Dyk, Oliver Lieb, Paul Oakenfold.

Another, 2022 album, Miracle in Transit by Naked Flames.
