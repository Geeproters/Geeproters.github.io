Archicembalo

Built in 1974 by the Formentelli workshop in collaboration with Marco Tiella. Strictly based on the descriptions found in book V of Nicola Vicentinos treatise L'antica musica ridotta alla prattica moderna (Rome 1555). The instrument was restored in 2016 by Fleig Orgelbau in collaboration with Studio31.

The instrument is iron strung and has three rows of jacks for one 8'-register with 36 keys / jacks / strings per octave. The reference pitch for a' is usually around 390 Hz. The keyboard has a range from F to c''', with an additional bass key. The bass octave can be tuned like a broken short octave or chromatically. The case and soundboard are made of cypress wood.

The keyboard layout is the same as the one for the Arciorgano, but with slightly different dimensions, leading to different ergonomics. The lower manual accommodates 19 keys per octave (with conventional diatonic white keys) by splitting all black keys into two parts and by adding a key between b and c and between e and f. The upper manual shares the same layout except the two additional keys between b and c and between e and f. The tuning is flexible and can freely be adapted, within the possibilities of the strings.
