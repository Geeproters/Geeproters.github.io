Deep House

Deep house is a genre of House music that grew out of Chicago House during the mid-1980s. Pioneered by Larry Heard and Marshall Jefferson, the genre is characterized by a relaxed tempo of around 110-125 BPM, soft pads, and muted basslines, and often features samples from Soul, Jazz, and Funk. Originally emerging from Chicago and New York, the genre spread to Europe in the early 1990s, where it saw considerable popularity. Deep house remained popular into the 2000s and 2010s, seeing some crossover with Tech House and Progressive House.

This is one of my preferred house subgenres. It's not hard to find good tracks within it. I'd recommend any of DJ Sprinkles, Against All Logic, Everything but the Girl

Here's a nice mix of mostly deep house. The first track is one by DJ Sprinkles from their 2008 album  Midtown 120 Blues.
