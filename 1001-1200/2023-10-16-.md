Guaguancó is a strain of Rumba cubana that emerged after the abolition of slavery in Cuba in 1886\. According to Mongo Santamaría, one of the most renowned guaguanco musicians, the genre originated when Afro-Cubans attempted to sing Flamenco. Guaguancó usually features a lead singer, accompanied by a battery of three large drums, known as tumbadoras or congas, and a call-and-response chorus.

Here's a song from Arsenio Rodríguez' Guaguancó/Son cubano 1960 album Primitivo

As a reminder, Son Cubano is a cuban style popular from the 1920s to the 1950s that combines the structure of Spanish song-oriented styles with African rhythms and percussion. one of my favorite albums, Buena Vista Social Club, belongs to this genre.
