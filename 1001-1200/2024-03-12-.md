Rock andino is a style of South American Rock that emerged in the Andean countries, especially Peru, Chile and Argentina, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, incorporating traditional instruments and harmonies from Indigenous Andean Music into electric instrumentation rock song structures, usually drawing influences from Progressive Rock and Psychedelic Rock from the time, as well as mixing indigenous imaginary with urban topics as an answer to the more US associated Latin Rock movement.

Peruvian El Polen, Chilean Los Jaivas and Argentinian Arco Iris are considered pioneers acts in the genre and main influences of the contemporary Andean urban music standards.

Los Jaivas \[El indio\] is a 1975 album by Chilean musical group Los Jaivas. They are considered one of the most important and influential artists of all time in Latin America.

Here are two other progressive rock records I like more than that previous one. These ones are from Argentina.
