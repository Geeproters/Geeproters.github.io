I watched the 2014 Godzilla recently. Movie was fine but this scene in particular was scored very nicely.

The track that plays is  György Ligeti's Requiem, composed between 1963 and 1965\.  
   
György Sándor Ligeti was a Hungarian-Austrian composer of contemporary classical music. He has been described as "one of the most important avant-garde composers in the latter half of the twentieth century" and "one of the most innovative and influential among progressive figures of his time".

Ligeti's "Requiem" lasts for just under half an hour, and is in four movements: "Introitus", a gradual unbroken plane of sound; "Kyrie", a complex polyphonic movement reaching a fortissimo climax; "Dies Irae", which uses vocal and orchestral extremes in theatrical gestures; and the closing "Lacrimosa", for soloists and orchestra only, which returns to the subdued atmosphere of the opening.

Next three will be on a few abstract/experimental hip hop albums from various countries I really enjoyed.

I'll skip describing them. They're all creative and worth a blind listen for that reason
