I recently listened through a bit of Fleet Foxes' self-titled 2008 debut album Chamber/Indie Folk album.

Here are a couple of standout tracks

Within the realms of alt and indie, Fleet Foxes are a very popular band. Though the group has experienced limited commercial success, their work has been consistently lauded by music critics, who have praised their lyricism and production style and often noted the band's use of refined instrumentation and vocal harmonies. The band's debut album was ranked by Rolling Stone among the best of the decade and was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.

In the past I feel like I might've given their music a try and didn't much care for it. I have since developed more of a taste for Indie and Folk, especially Chamber Folk, and thus have a somewhat better appreciation for them.
