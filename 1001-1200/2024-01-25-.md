Hypnagogic Pop by nature is a diverse genre. There's a lot of interesting stuff from it, so I'll rec a few more H-Pop albums for the next recs.

Here's George Clanton's 2018 album Slide

This one takes more from Baggy, and can also be described as Chillwave, Synthpop, and Vapor.

Lush, summery, joyous, passionate, and futuristic. It's a genre classic that does everything it sets out to do excellently.
