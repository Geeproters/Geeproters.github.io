Canzone napoletana is a traditional form of music sung in the Neapolitan language by a male voice with instrumental accompaniment, originating in the city of Naples and surrounding regions. Its main topics are love and south Italian folklore. It most probably originated in the XIII century, out of popular songs about nature and everyday life. These songs were developed in the XV century when Neapolitan became an official language of the kingdom and in the following centuries were enriched, especially in the XVIII century by Opera buffa. Since the XIX century, Neapolitan song's range of themes was expanding, and this process continues up to this day, mixing with and taking inspiration from other popular music.

From Pino Daniele's 1980 album Nero a metà.

Nero a metà dances between jazz, rock, blues, funk, and other genres. It is at times playful and romantic, and at others melancholic or mellow. The 3 songs I recced are ones I enjoy, but the whole is really great and worth a listen for anyone interested in singer-songwriter music or Italian music, in my opinion.
