Cuplé originally developed in the 19th century as a blend of old theatre Spanish styles based in short monologues (jácara and tonadilla) and French Couplet. Its golden era was during the first quarter of the 20th century. In its early form Cuplé was sung by a female ‘cupletista’ (cuplé singer) for a male audience and was considered a ‘género ínfimo’ (a minor, banal, frivolous and vulgar genre). The lyrics were playful, with a strong sexual content based in double entendres; political satire was common too. In the 1910s-20s Cuplé gained respectability and started to be performed to audiences of both sexes, with lighter sexual content and more romantic themes, particularly about lost and unrequited love.

During the 1930s Cuplé went into decline and evolved into Copla, which replaced the French influences by Andalusian folkloric elements. In the 1950s Cuplé went briefly back into fashion with the huge success of the film El último cuplé \[Valencia\].

Here's El ultimo cuplé \[The Last Torch Song\], released 1957

Not much new Cuplé music has been recorded since then, but it still has a strong influence in most ‘canción española’ and genres such as ‘revista’ (Revue) or Chotis madrileño. Some of the most popular Cuplé artists are Raquel Meller, La Fornarina, La Goya, Pastora Imperio and (later on) Sara Montiel.
