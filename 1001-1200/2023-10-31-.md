Guarania is a popular style of Paraguayan music created by the composer José Asunción Flores in 1925\. It is most commonly played on the Paraguayan harp.

The Paraguayan polka originated in the mid-19th century with the introduction of European ballroom dance in that country. At that time, the name "polka" would begin to be used by the Paraguayan people to define their own popular music, of Jesuit and Spanish origin. The genre would continue to evolve, with numerous songs documented in the songbook Álbum de los toques más populares del Paraguay in 1877, and would end up giving rise to the Guarania. Since then, the Paraguayan polka has continued to mutate, adopting various influences (such as the Nuevo Cancionero and the Milonga, among others) and deriving into various subgenres, such as polka fusión or polka quejumbrosa.

Here's a 1968 album, Guarani Songs and Dances by Los Chiriguanos of Paraguay. It covers a lot of ground, including the above two styles.
