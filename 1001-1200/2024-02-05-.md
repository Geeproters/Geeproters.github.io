Omara Portuondo Peláez (born 1930\) is a Cuban singer and dancer. A founding member of the popular vocal group Cuarteto d'Aida, Portuondo has collaborated with many important Cuban musicians during her long career, including Julio Gutiérrez, Juanito Márquez and Chucho Valdés. Although primarily known for her rendition of boleros, she has recorded in a wide range of styles from jazz to son cubano. Since 1996, she has been part of the Buena Vista Social Club project, touring extensively and recording several albums with the ensemble.

She is particularly associated with the traditional Cuban music genre of bolero, and has made significant contributions to the global recognition of Cuban music.

She's got a beautiful, rich, and soulful voice.

Here's the 2000 album Buena Vista Social Club Presents: Omara Portuondo. This is classified as a bolero album, which I'll alk more about next rec.

One more thing; Manuel Galbán was a Grammy-winning Cuban guitarist, pianist and arranger, most notable for his work with Los Zafiros, Ry Cooder and the Buena Vista Social Club.

Here are a couple of short songs from his 2012 album Blue Cha Cha.

That second one features Omara Portuondo. When I first listened, I found that it was sung with such sadness and melodrama that I laughed at it. It's grown on me since then, as a beautiful, sorrowful song.

Here's an album by her from 2023, Vida. Timestamped to another version of Duele, this time accompanied by piano.

I'd be hard pressed to find a 93 year old singer who sounds better than she does.

Following that rec on Omara Portuondo Peláez, I've decided to do a short series on various Cuban dance and pop genres.

I'm not super well versed in these, so I'm not sure how long this one will last, but I doubt it'll go beyond 7\. I've already talked about a few Cuban genres already, including Rumba cubana, Guaguancó, a whole mini-series on salsa, and Son Cubano several times in the past, so I won't cover all of the obvious ones.
