Portrait With Firewood is a 2018 Electronic album by Djrum

DjRUM is recognized for his exceptional production skills, initially rooted in the UK Bass/Garage scene with influences from Burial (see rec 490). Over time, his sound has evolved, maintaining various styles of Drum and Bass but incorporating a cinematic flair characterized by classical instrumentation and atmospheric build-up.

I'm a sucker for "orchestral electronic" as I've called it before, and this album does great things with that idea on a few standout tracks. Super atmospheric.
