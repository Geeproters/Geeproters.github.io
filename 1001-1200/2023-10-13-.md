Flamenco Nuevo was developed in the 1970s and is a style with roots in flamenco music, but at the same time departed from tradition and blended with other genres like Jazz, Blues, and Rock.

In 1975, Lole y Manuel released Nuevo día, considered at the time, arguably, the first nuevo flamenco record, it was a fusion of traditional flamenco with modern instrumentation and influences and new approaches to traditional flamenco palos, but still rooted in flamenco. His producer, Ricardo Pachón, also produced the controversial La leyenda del tiempo, which at the time was literally destroyed by outraged Camarón de la Isla fans, although it was eventually reevaluated to the point of probably being the most acclaimed nuevo flamenco record nowadays. Its fusion of styles is now deemed as equally pivotal for nuevo flamenco as was "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" for Pop Rock music.

From Camarón's 1979 album La leyenda del tiempo. This album also takes from bulería palo

Bulería is distinguished by its fast rhythm and emphasized usage of jaleo (shouts) and palmas (clapping). The most notable characteristic of bulería is its twelve-beat structure comprised of alternating sections of 3/4 and 6/8 time signatures. As such, bulerías are often considered one of the most complicated varieties of flamenco. Most bulerías are written in Phrygian mode.
