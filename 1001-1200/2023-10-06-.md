Mongolian throat singing (aka Mongolian Overtone Singing), is characterized by harmonic overtones produced by controlled airflows in the mouth and throat, essentially generating multiple pitches at the same time. It is thought that the art of overtone singing originated in southwestern Mongolia in today's Khovd Province and Govi Altai region. Nowadays, overtone singing is found throughout the country and Mongolia is often considered the most active center of overtone singing in the world.

No one can say for sure when the art of throat singing began. Historical records mention it as early as the Han Dynasty, between 206 – 220 BC.

Mongols utilise six xöömii techniques: nasal, pharyngal, thoracic, abdominal, narrative, and isgerex (known as the voice of nasal flute) in overtone singing.

Egschiglen are a Mongolian folk band, formed in Ulan Bator in 1991\. They are one of very few traditional Mongolian bands to have become internationally popular. Here are a couple tracks from their album 2002, Zazal.

It's an impressive and diverse album with a lot of variety between the songs, which range from songs featuring those many types of throat singing techniques, to upbeat pop with clean female vocals, to modern classical compositions, to atmospheric meditative long songs.
