From Fabrizio De André's 1970 album La buona novella.

La buona novella incorporates elements of Chamber Folk music, Choral music, and Hymns.

Fabrizio Cristiano De André was an Italian singer-songwriter and the most-prominent cantautore of his time. His 40-year career reflects his interests in concept albums, literature, poetry, political protest, and French music. He is considered a prominent member of the Genoese School. He's got an incredible warm voice that fits the sentimental feel of his music.

La buona novella focuses on religion and its relationship with the ordinary man, a reoccurring theme throughout the entirety of his discography. The execution of this concept certainly takes on a definitive form here, with De André (a confessed atheist) revisiting the apocryphal (discarded/lost) gospels of the Bible in order to humanise its characters by exposing their flaws. It doesn't try to demean the figure of of Jesus, instead simply downplaying the miracle making side in favour of portraying the outcast Jesus.

I'll have to re-listen through this album while reading along with the lyrics some time soon.
