Funaná is an upbeat Cape Verdean style of music. The style is based around the accordion (specifically the diatonic accordion) with the rhythm typically being provided by a ferrinho, and guitar, bass guitar, synthesizer and drums are sometimes also used. Songs are structured around a series of strophes separated by a refrain, and accordion solos are played between the refrain and the different strophes. Lyrics often focus on themes of day-to-day life, and sometimes also turn to self-reflection or political themes; topics are approached in an indirect way, making use of proverbs and figures of speech.

Heres a song that exemplifies those above traits well. From Ferro Gaita's 2001 album Rei Di Funana

Funaná first developed on the island of Santiago, and although the origins of both the style itself and its name are contested, funaná was first used to describe the Santiagian accordion music (previously known as either fuc-fuc or badju l’ gaita) in the 1960s. The music had existed long before that, but was restricted to rural areas, and was only revived and made popular after independence. Bulimundo was most responsible for this revival, spreading the genre to all of the Cape Verdean islands in the 1980s.

During the 1990s, funaná found itself spreading beyond the islands of Cape Verde, with Finaçon's international distribution allowing it to find popularity in countries such as Portugal and France. The most recent development in funaná has been the emergence of an Electronic take on the genre, which has become popular with DJs across the world alongside other African Electronic Dance Music styles such as Kuduro and Kwaito.
