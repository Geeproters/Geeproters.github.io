Both albums feature other great artists, as well; JPEGMAFIA, Danny Brown, and Aesop Rock, among others. These few tracks alone aren't enough to give a good of these albums, which are very diverse and vary greatly from track to track. One common thread, however, is the surreal and impressionistic lyricism of Billy Woods and his unique storytelling style. Fans of experimental or abstract hip-hop or jazz rap will enjoy these.
