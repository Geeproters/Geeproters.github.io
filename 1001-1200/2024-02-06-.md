Habanera

Habanera (aka Cuban contradanza) originated in the 19th century in Cuba, this genre had its origin in the French "contradanza". It is based around the Habanera rhythm which incorporates a "dotted quaver" feel, where the most typical instruments used are guitars, lutes and bandurrias.

Ernesto Lecuona y Casado was a Cuban composer and pianist, many of whose works have become standards of the Latin, jazz and classical repertoires. His over 600 compositions include songs and zarzuelas as well as pieces for piano and symphonic orchestra.

Here's his "La Habanera," which is a habanera, though it doesn't use the most typical instruments. Casado lived from 1896 to 1963, but I'm not sure when this piece was composed.
