I talked about Bjork on rec 594 after putting off listening to her music for a long time. I listen to her somewhat regularly now, and she's among my favorite Electronic songwriters.

Her body of work exhibits a huge variety of styles, but she always nail that sense of euphoria that electronic music gives that few other (if any) genres can achieve.

Here are a couple for her singles from 1995 and 1997, respectively. The first, Hyperballad, was also included in her album Post. The second, JÃ³ga, was included in her album Homogenic.
