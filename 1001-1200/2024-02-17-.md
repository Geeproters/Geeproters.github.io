Here's Blackouts by Ashra, from 1977  
[https://youtu.be/fmj1DMQN7gI](https://youtu.be/fmj1DMQN7gI)

This one is again described as Berlin School, but it also belongs to the genre of Krautrock. The association between the two may become more clear upon listening.

I'm not as big a fan of this album as the previous one, but it's a fun listen.
