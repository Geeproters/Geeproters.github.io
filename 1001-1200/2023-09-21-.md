Also known as micromontage, microsound is the usage of sounds on an incredibly small scale. These sounds usually last from 10 milliseconds to less than a tenth of a second. By arranging and manipulating these sounds digitally, complex patterns and compositions can be made in ways that aren't possible via solely acoustic means.

Microsound shares some similarities with Lowercase (see rec 471), as both genres use microsounds and work to magnify and structure songs around sounds that would otherwise be inaudible or not focused on. However, microsound as a genre is focused almost entirely on being produced digitally, and is more structurally focused than the often improvised nature of lowercase. The genre also shares similarities with Glitch music, to the point where the terms "microsound" and "glitch" are often conflated. While glitch can be incorporated into microsound, microsound is more deliberate in its nature and does not focus on emulating malfunctioning technology or sounds in order to be created.

One example of an artists in the genre is Ryoji Ikeda, who also incorporates elements of Minimal Techno in his music, as well as incorporating his music in sound installations. Here's a track from Ikeda's 2005 album Dataplex.
