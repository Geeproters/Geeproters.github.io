Beginning shortly after World War I as a reaction to what some composers perceived as the excesses of Romanticism, Neoclassicism returned to the more formal and less expansive structures and forms common in the 18th century. The harmonic and melodic material, however, was decidedly modern and avoided the emotionalism and programmatic tendencies common among the Romantics in favor of purely abstract material.

A few precursor pieces of this movement traced back to the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, in particular some of Сергей Прокофьев \[Sergei Prokofiev\]'s work. The most prominent composers are Igor Stravinsky and Paul Hindemith, as well as Francis Poulenc, Benjamin Britten or Krzysztof Penderecki.
