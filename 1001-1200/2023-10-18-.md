Copla. 'Tonadilla escénica', a Spanish theatre style from the 18th Century, is arguably the biggest influence of Copla. Later on, Copla evolved from Cuplé in the 1920s/1930s, replacing the French Couplet influences by Andalusian folkloric elements. Some of the earliest Copla singers were Conchita Piquer, Imperio Argentina, Juanita Reina and Miguel de Molina.

Copla has strong links with Flamenco and it is common for many Copla singers to incorporate Flamenco in their repertoire, (this also happens the other way around). From the 60s/70s it has been common to blend Copla with Canción melódica. In the 80s/90s Carlos Cano and Martirio renewed Copla, which had been criticized for perpetuating a clichéd and stereotyped image of Spain, and attracted with their 'Nueva Copla' a younger and more varied audience.
