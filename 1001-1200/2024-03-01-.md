Just finished watching Chungking Express, which stars Faye Wong (see rec 637 in my mandopop series).

This song of hers plays a few times in it. It's a cover of The Cranberries‘ debut single “Dreams”, which was released in 1992\.

I'm not sure if it sounds nostalgic to me because my mom might have used to listen to it, or because I've heard the original version before. Either way, it's a nice song.
