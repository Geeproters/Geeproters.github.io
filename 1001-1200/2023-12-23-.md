Chicago House

Chicago house is an umbrella term for a broad variety of house music that originated from Chicago in the (mostly mid-to-late) 1980s and early 90s. This includes some of the first ever house music recordings and thus, Chicago is generally considered to be house music's birthplace. It is believed that the genre got its name from a Chicago club, named "the Warehouse".

Chicago house musicians often drew inspiration from genres such as Synthpop, Italo-Disco and Funk, paired with a 4/4 house beat. The genre is often associated with Acid House, which has the same geographic origins. Commonly used instruments in Chicago house are the Roland TB-303, the Roland TR-808 and the Roland TR-909, amongst others.

Important artists in the genre include Derrick Carter, Frankie Knuckles and Joe Smooth. Many of the most influential Chicago house tracks were released on the labels D.J. International Records and Trax Records. Due to the success of these releases, the styles that Chicago producers pioneered soon started to spread outside of Chicago, most notably towards New York and the UK.
