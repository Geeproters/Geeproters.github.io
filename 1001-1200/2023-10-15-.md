Flamenco Pop, originally developed in the mid 1960s, incorporated palos flamencos and Copla (more on that later) into the format of feisty and lively Pop music (particularly, Yé-yé). It was strongly influenced by Rumba flamenca, but Flamenco Pop isn't a palo flamenco, and is considered 'pop aflamencado', pop with some flamenco overtones, such as the singing style and rhythms.

Since the late 1990s the new acts of Flamenco Pop are commonly referred as 'Flamenkito', a style where ballads and mid-tempos are frequent too, and it has more contemporary influences such as Dance-Pop or even Reggaetón. It is dismissed by critics by its superficial and clichéd 'light' flamenco elements. Nonetheless, it has become very popular amongst a young audience that in most cases isn't interested in more pure forms of flamenco music.

Here are a couple popular flamenco pop songs. Rosalía (rec 743\) has also worked in the genre.
