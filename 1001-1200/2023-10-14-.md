Flamenco jazz is the combination of Jazz and contemporary flamenco (aka Flamenco nuevo). It was pioneered in the late 1960s by Spanish saxophonist Pedro Iturralde and famous guitarist Paco de Lucía. Flamenco jazz pieces where jazz improvisation is integrated into the core elements of flamenco, specifically the flamenco mode and the Andalusian cadence, were especially criticized by flamenco purists in the early days. Since the late 1980s, younger generations of flamenco musicians have expanded the genre with new instruments and styeles as criticism from the conservative side of the flamenco world waned.

Here's a track from Pedro Iturralde's ¡Jazz Flamenco\!, released 1967
