Everything Harmony is a 2023 Soft Rock / Pop Rock album by The Lemon Twigs. The Lemon Twigs is an American rock band from Long Island, New York, fronted by brothers Brian and Michael D'Addario (born 1997 and 1999). Both brothers are vocalists, songwriters and multi-instrumentalists,

Here're a few songs off the album.

This album and their music in general is obviously derivative, and clearly meant to express a vintage aesthetic. It is inspired by and comparable to many albums around 50 years older than itself. Very warm, soft, and lush.

I can't quite put my finger on it, but listening to the first half of "When Winter Comes Around" is like stepping more than a decade into my own past. Maybe it's similar to the type of music I would hear in church daycare or some such, or maybe it's similar to the music I would hear my dad listen to.

In any case, The Lemon Twigs were absolutely successful in achieving what they set out to. I think the album serves as something more than just a throwback.
