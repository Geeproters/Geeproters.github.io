The Guianas, sometimes called by the Spanish loan-word Guayanas (Las Guayanas), is a region in north-eastern South America which includes the following three territories:

	\-French Guiana, an overseas department and region of France  
	\-Guyana, formerly known as British Guiana from 1831 until 1966, after the colonies of Berbice, Essequibo, and Demerara, taken from the Netherlands in 1814, were merged into a single colony  
	\-Suriname, formerly Dutch Guiana, until 1814 together with Berbice, Essequibo and Demerara

In the wider context, the Guianas also includes the following two territories:

	\-Guayana Region in eastern Venezuela (Amazonas, Bolívar, and Delta Amacuro states), formerly the Guayana Province, alternatively known as Spanish Guayana (or Venezuelan Guiana)  
	\-State of Amapá in northern Brazil, known as Portuguese Guiana (or Brazilian Guiana)

The combined population of the three core territories is 1,718,651; 804,567 in Guyana, 612,985 in Suriname and 301,099 in French Guiana. Due to their isolated terrain and geography, the Guianas are one of the most sparsely populated regions on Earth.

The music of The Guianas is rich and varied. This and the next few recs will be on some interesting music from each of the three core territories.

First, here's a short recording of music in the traditional style of the original inhabitants of the Guianas, the Kalina people.
