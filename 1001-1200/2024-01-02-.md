Samba-jazz is a Jazz genre developed in Brazil in the early 1960s in conjunction with the Bossa nova movement. It fuses American jazz with Samba or Bossa nova elements. The samba variant is combined with Hard Bop featuring fast paced rhythms and generally performed in small groups with drums, piano and bass being the main instruments but can be expanded in larger ensembles to feature horns and guitar. The bossa nova variant is more influenced by Cool Jazz and goes for a mellower sound, usually incorporating the saxophone.

Here's Coisas, a 1965 Samba-jazz and Jongo album by Moacir Santos
