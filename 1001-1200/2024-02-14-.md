Progressive electronic is a genre that emerged in the late 1960s, embracing synthesizers and innovative production. It's characterized by complex soundscapes, rhythmic changes, and improvisation, often featuring lengthy compositions.

Influences stem from Progressive Rock and Krautrock, with pioneers like Pink Floyd and Tangerine Dream. Ambient music, pioneered by Brian Eno, shared similarities and overlapped with progressive electronic. In the 1980s, artists like Jean Michel Jarre expanded the genre, integrating Modern Classical and regional music alongside new technologies. By the 1990s, its influence extended to Electronic Dance Music, spawning new genres like IDM and Ambient Techno. In the 21st century, progressive electronic continues to evolve, blending with Industrial, Minimalism, and regional Classical Music.

Here's a track from Trans Europa Express, a 1977 album by Kraftwerk, and the highest rated Progressive Electronic album on RYM.
