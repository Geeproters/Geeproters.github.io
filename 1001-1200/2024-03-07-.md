Winter synth is a subgenre of Dungeon Synth coined by blogger Balbulus in 2013 to describe releases that were inspired by and reflected the elemental forces of nature. The active period of the blog was fairly short-lived, applying the term retroactively to older releases, but it would continue to serve as a source of reference and cement the concepts that define the genre.

Winter synth is slightly more minimalistic than dungeon synth, focusing on establishing a wide open feel not unlike that of an open landscape, while also incorporating imagery of snow, ice, forests, and mountains. Because of this minimalism, releases tend to have more overlap with Dark Ambient and Drone than regular dungeon synth. Common features of winter synth include Field Recordings of winter wind for ambience, heavy use of reverb, long-release pads coupled with resonant synth lines, and synth hits with a crystalline or shimmering quality. Percussion is frequently absent, and when present tends to be limited. These elements combine to create cold and expansive soundscapes, which often reflect the winter-themed imagery present in the album art.

One of the earliest and most notable examples of winter synth is Die Festung by Paysage d'Hiver, with similar material coming from Vinterriket in the early to mid-2000s.

Here's the first track of of Paysage d'Hiver's 1998 album Die Festung

Later acts that emerged in the 2010s such as Eislandschaft and Inoriand would directly reference both these early artists and Balbulus's blog as inspiration.
