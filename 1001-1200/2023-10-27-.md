Andalusian Classical Music

Andalusia is a large autonomous region of hills, rivers and farmland bordering Spain’s southern coast. It was under Moorish rule from the 8th-15th centuries. Al-Andalus was the Muslim-ruled area of the Iberian Peninsula. The term is used by modern historians for the former Islamic states in modern Spain, Portugal, and France. The name describes the different Muslim states that controlled these territories at various times between 711 and 1492\.

Although the origins of Andalusian classical music are unsure, it is generally thought that it had its beginnings in the Emirate of Cordoba (in Al-Andalus, the region of the Iberian Peninsula under Moorish control) in the 9th century, and sometimes Abu l-Hasan (also known as Ziryâb) is credited in particular as its inventor. It spread across North Africa, and is now most associated with Morocco.
