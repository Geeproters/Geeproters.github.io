Amapiano is a type of South African House music that originated in the area of Johannesburg around 2016, deriving from previous popular genres including Gqom and Kwaito as well as Deep House. Under the influence of a series of producers such as Kabza de Small, TNS, Sun-El Musician, Samthing Soweto, MFR Souls, and DJ Maphorisa, it became the dominant sound of South African house in 2019\.

Amapiano is distinguished by its intricate rhythm and percussion, high-pitched synth melodies reminiscent of Lounge, Jazz or church organ, and thumping basslines. Compositions are characterized by long developments and can vary between a laid-back groovy atmosphere and a more aggressive sound. On the dancefloor, it is danced in a similar fashion to gqom.

The "ama" in amapiano denotes a plural in Zulu, so the genre name simply means "pianos".

Here's one example. Not a big fan of the kick that comes in at around 1:40 but its a nice track.
