Algerian Chaabi

Chaabi is a form of Arabic music, originating from Algiers in Algeria. It draws influences from Andalusian Classical Music and Amazigh Music, with mournful vocals over an orchestral setting of violins, mandolins, pianos and percussion. محمد العنقة الحاج \[El Hadj M'hamed el Anka\] was considered the foremost early performer, while other prominent artists include الهاشمي الكروابي \[El Hachemi Guerouabi\] and Dahmane El Harrachi.

Here's a playlist for Abdel Hadi Halo & The El Gusto Orchestra of Algiers self-titled 2007 album
