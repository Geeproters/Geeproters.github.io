Yuja Wang is a Chinese pianist. Born in Beijing, she began learning piano there at age six, and went on to study at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing and the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia.

By age 21, she was already an internationally recognized concert pianist and signed an exclusive contract with Deutsche Grammophon. She has since established herself as one of the leading artists of her generation. Many consider her to be the best current performing pianist.

Here's a short part of one performance, Rachmaninov: Prelude in G Minor, Op. 23, No. 5

Here's a longer one, Prokofiev: Piano concerto no.2 op.16:

Yuja Wang's playing style is characterized by its electrifying energy, technical precision, and emotional depth. She plays with unparalleled agility and a fearless approach, amd often pushes the boundaries of classical interpretation with her unique flair and mastery of the piano.

I think I first heard about her after some controversial comments were made about the way she dresses in her performances: In a much-quoted 2011 review of a concert at the Hollywood Bowl, Los Angeles Times classical music critic Mark Swed wrote:

"But it was Yuja Wang's orange dress for which Tuesday night is likely to be rememberedâ€¦ Her dress Tuesday was so short and tight that had there been any less of it, the Bowl might have been forced to restrict admission to any music lover under 18 not accompanied by an adult. Had her heels been any higher, walking, to say nothing of her sensitive pedaling, would have been unfeasible."

Swed was criticized for this aspect of his review in a Washington Post article titled "Which offends? Her short dress or critic's narrow view?."

I love classical music but sexism in the industry is absolutely still prevalent.
