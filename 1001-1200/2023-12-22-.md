Garage house

Garage House, born from DJ Larry Levan's selections at Paradise Garage in NYC, blended Disco, R\&B, Gospel, Dub, New Wave, and Rock. Michael de Benedictus's synthesizer accompaniment and Levan's studio work added dub-influenced effects. François K.'s mixing influenced the spatial, dub-inflected sound.

Unlike Chicago House, garage house retained disco's gospel and soul elements with smoother production values. The Jersey Sound from Club Zanzibar and Movin' Records emphasized songwriting, featuring syncopated high hats and minor chord synth pads, dominating garage house in the late '80s and early '90s. Kenny Dope and Louie Vega of Masters at Work, along with Strictly Rhythm Records, further evolved the sound in New York, with staccato piano riffs and synth stabs becoming iconic in the 1990s.

In the mid-'90s, garage's influence reached overseas, shaping UK Garage with its soulful sounds, sped-up rhythms, and chopped vocal samples, led by DJs and producers in the UK and American Todd Edwards.

Here are two tracks from House Rulez \[하우스룰즈\]'s 2007 album Mojito
