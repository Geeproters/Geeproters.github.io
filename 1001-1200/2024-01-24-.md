Hypnagogic pop, emerging in the 2000s, unites the music of underground Neo-Psychedelia and Noise artists with a shared nostalgic approach. Influenced by 1970s/1980s popular music, artists tap into childhood memories, often utilizing outdated recording tech and formats like analog synthesizers, retro FX, cassette, and VHS. Common references include Synthpop, Rock, synthesizer soundtracks, and New Age, distorted through experimental composition, studio FX, and tape hiss.

James Ferraro and Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti are early figureheads, with scenes around labels like Not Not Fun Records.

Here's an album by the latter, House Arrest / Lover Boy by Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti, from 2002

You can hear the 80s Jangle Pop and Slacker Rock influences pretty strongly.

Coined by David Keenan in 2009, hypnagogic pop is described as "pop music refracted through the memory of a memory." It's distinct from Chillwave, emphasizing a more experimental and conceptual approach over accessible pop hooks. This movement significantly influences the more popular Vaporwave genre, sharing a fascination with 1980s pop culture but departing from its lo-fi sound.
