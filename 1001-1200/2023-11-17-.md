Vocal Trance

Vocal trance is a form of Trance music that emerged during the mid-1990s. The genre often provides characteristic vocals applied to Pop music and emphasizes the melodic and harmonic elements of trance productions. Tracks commonly range between 120-145 BPM and usually draw resemblances to Progressive Trance, Uplifting Trance and Progressive House structures. The nature of vocal trance music is different from other similar types of trance, including Euro-Trance, which frequently incorporates live vocals but orientates on the punchier elements adjacent to Hard Trance and the straightforward appeal of Eurodance. The slower progressive house from the late 2000s also became influenced by vocal trance while simultaneously adapting polished elements from Electro House music.

The genre went into widespread popularity around Europe during the turn of the millennium with producers Sylver, Lasgo and Milk Inc. becoming important early exponents of the sound, and further popularized in the mid-2000s by TiÃ«sto, Above & Beyond and Armin van Buuren's A State of Trance DJ mixes. Public interest began to decline after the mid-2010s due to shifting trends in the EDM market.

Not a big fan of this genre in general. I think live vocals and trance are usually best kept separate.
