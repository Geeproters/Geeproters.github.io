Gamelan degung is a specific type of Sundanese musical ensemble that originates from the island of Java in Indonesia. Gamelan itself refers to a traditional ensemble music form that primarily consists of percussive instruments, including gongs, metallophones, and drums. Each gamelan ensemble has its own distinct tuning and instrumentation, reflecting regional styles and cultural influences.

Gamelan degung features a unique subset of modified gamelan instruments and is characterized by its use of the pelog scale, which consists of seven notes arranged in a non-standard tuning system. This distinct approach creates a rich tapestry of sound that is both intricate and melodic. 

The combination of its unique style, instrumentation, and the ethereal quality of its recordings imparts a dreamlike atmosphere, making gamelan degung suitable for relaxation or meditation.
