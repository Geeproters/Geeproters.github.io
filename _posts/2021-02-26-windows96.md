Vaporwave is a sample-based genre that manipulates corporate mood music, pop, R&B, smooth jazz, and exotica into ambient, echo-laden pieces. Originating with “Eccojams” (such as Eccojams Vol. 1 by Chuck Person), vaporwave uses heavy reverb, glitching, looping, and slowing techniques to transform familiar sounds into hyper-real, dreamlike caricatures of 1980s and ’90s media. The name “vaporwave” references “vaporware,” which is software or hardware that has been advertised but is not yet available to buy, either because it is only a concept or because it is still being written or designed, suggesting a nostalgic disconnect from reality. 

Popularized by Far Side Virtual (James Ferraro) and Floral Shoppe (Macintosh Plus), the genre’s popularity exploded in 2012, spawning subgenres like vaportrap and future funk, which blend elements from trap, French house, and nu-disco. Though the sound has evolved, vaporwave and its offshoots remain central to a broader “vapor” movement, maintaining its satirical, nostalgic aesthetic.
