Pacific reggae is a subgenre of reggae that originated in the island communities of the Pacific Ocean, characterized by the incorporation of elements from the native Oceanian music of the region. Due to the geographical distance between its various scenes, Pacific reggae has developed independently into several distinct variations, unified by the use of Austronesian instrumentation and performance styles, particularly in percussion. This subgenre is often described as smoother and more rhythmically flowing, in contrast to the staccato nature of Jamaican reggae. While it is typically sung in local dialects of English, some Pacific reggae artists perform in their native Austronesian languages. The lyrics frequently address socially conscious themes reminiscent of Roots Reggae, with Austronesians expressing solidarity with Afro-Jamaicans by reflecting on their colonial experiences and oppression.

The term Polynesian reggae, or "Poly reggae," encompasses substyles from Polynesia that specifically draw on traditional Polynesian music. Hawaiian reggae, also known as "Jawaiian," emerged in the mid-1980s and incorporates traditional Hawaiian elements, including the use of the ukulele and adaptations of local melodies. 

New Zealand has a notable scene within the genre, influenced by MƒÅori music, particularly following Bob Marley's 1979 tour of the country. In recent years, the various scenes within Pacific reggae have increasingly converged, leading to inter-island collaborations and a growing popularity of artists across the region.
