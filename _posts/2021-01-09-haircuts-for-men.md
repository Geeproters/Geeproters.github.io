Haircuts for Men, also known as Andre Maximillion, creates music in the genres of vaporwave, downtempo, instrumental hip hop, and chillwave. He employs sequencer and tracker techniques used in compositions for early home computers and game consoles from the late 1980s to the late 1990s, primarily drawing inspiration from video game soundtracks. His songs feature interesting textures and complexities, but what I appreciate most is the mood they convey—chill, often energetic, sometimes lethargic. He has a massive discography, though much of it isn't available on YouTube as of now. Here’s one of his albums:
