Death Grips is an American experimental hip hop group formed in 2010 in Sacramento, California. They've been one of my favorite bands for ages, and have amassed a large cult following.

At some point in the past decade, a trend arose where mashups were made of their songs with songs of practically any other genre. There have been dozens and dozens of these, but here are some of my faovrites:
