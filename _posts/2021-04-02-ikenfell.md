Digital fusion is an electronic genre that grew from the Chiptune and demoscene scenes in the 2000s, as artists began moving beyond traditional hardware. It combines Chiptune-inspired synths with a variety of influences, including Jazz Fusion, Smooth Jazz, Synth Funk, Progressive Rock, and Electronic Dance Music. Digital fusion may use live instrumentation, like piano or drums, or "virtual improvisation," where solos are recorded by a sequencer, allowing for post-performance adjustments. 

The genre developed largely online, with netlabels like Ubiktune and DESKPOP Music supporting it, and has featured in indie video game music (Celeste, FEZ) and TV scores. Aivi Tran coined the term "digital fusion" in 2019 as a banner for musicians, which the community quickly embraced.

Ikenfell's 2020 OST by aivi & surasshu is a strong example of digital fusion, blending piano, guitar, and chiptune. Here are some standout tracks:

[Forest of Secrets](https://youtu.be/xn4HIR1BbjE) - an easy-going, ragtime-inspired track  

[Roses are Black 2](https://youtu.be/hrlPgT8fTYo) - atmospheric and ambient  

[The Girl in the Mirror - Pertisia's Theme](https://youtu.be/nSYpF3xohoE) - a classical fusion waltz  

[Rhythm of the Wild - Battle 1](https://youtu.be/C5Xk1qFtiFU) - upbeat, wild-west strings
