Electronic body music (EBM), also known as industrial dance music, is a genre that merges elements of industrial music with electronic dance music. Emerging in the early 1980s in Germany and Belgium, EBM has since gained traction across Europe and beyond.

One notable entry in this genre is the album "Мразь" (Scum) by the Russian EBM/darkwave project ШТАДТ (STADT). A grimy post-punk and industrial sound, reminiscent of the work of the prolific artist FILMMAKER mentioned earlier, but featuring Russian vocals.
