Gregory and the Hawk is the project of singer-songwriter Meredith Godreau, who is known for her ethereal voice and intimate songwriting. 

Her 2008 Indie Folk album Moenie and Kitchi captures a delicate blend of indie-pop and folk elements, creating an soothing and reflective atmosphere. The lyrics explore themes of introspection and vulnerability, or into feelings of doubt, heartache, and the fleeting nature of love.

Godreau is able to convey complex emotions through evocative melodies. The production is mellow, atmospheric, and intentinoally raw at times, and it allows her voice and the acoustic instrumentation to shine perfectly.
