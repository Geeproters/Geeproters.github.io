Punch Brothers is an American ensemble featuring Chris Thile, Brittany Haas, Noam Pikelny, Chris Eldridge, and Paul Kowert. Their music blends "bluegrass instrumentation and spontaneity within the framework of modern classical," often described as "American country-classical chamber music."

Here's a song from their 2015 Progressive Bluegrass album, The Phosphorescent Blues:

Claude Debussy, who composed Passepied (meaning "pass-foot," a French court dance) is frequently regarded as the first Impressionist composer, based on his focus on mood and atmosphere. The Punch Brothers creatively merge this piece with elements of progressive bluegrass music.

Here are two very different progressive bluegrass pieces by Punch Brothers. These two are originals featuring Chris Thile's vocals:
