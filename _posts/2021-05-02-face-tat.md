Linear drumming is a style where no drum or cymbal hits simultaneously, creating unique, unlayered rhythms. This approach allows drummers to build complex, varied phrases by combining different drum kit voices in succession, without overlaps. It can be applied across different tempos and time signatures, often using double stroke rudiments and single stroke rudiments between the hands and feet in a succession of sixteenth notes or triplets to create fast, intricate fills. Linear drumming has been popularized by artists like Steve Gadd and Jeff Porcaro and has also influenced electronic and hip-hop music.

Zach Hill frequently incorporates linear drumming into his style, giving his playing a really engaging texture and flow.
