ENA is a character and web series by animator Joel G, set in a surreal, retro-futuristic world that mixes abstract visuals, glitchy aesthetics, and nostalgic internet themes. The style taps into a genre sometimes referred to as “webcore” or “internetcore,” where the digital world is portrayed as a bizarre, immersive, and slightly unsettling space. The character ENA and her adventures have inspired playlists like this one, capturing a sci-fi, otherworldly vibe and pulling together the soundscapes of early internet nostalgia, oddball aesthetics, and vaporwave.
