Hardvapour is a genre that emerged from the vaporwave movement around 2015, gaining traction through labels like Dream Catalogue and Antifur. It is characterized by a blend of vaporwave elements with techno and IDM, incorporating influences from hardcore EDM subgenres like speedcore and gabber. Hardvapour began with the music released under the aliases of wosX and was conceived as a counter-movement to vaporwave, favoring a darker, more aggressive, and rhythmic sound over the genre's ambient tendencies. The term was popularized with the release of "Vaporwave Is Dead" by Sandtimer, which included the track "Welcome to Hardvapour."

The hardvapour scene distinguishes itself from other vaporwave derivatives by often rejecting the original genre's messages and aesthetics, relying less on sampling. A notable visual aspect of hardvapour is the use of Cyrillic characters in album and song titles, contrasting with the Japanese scripts common in vaporwave. While it retains a countercultural ethos, hardvapour often shifts focus from Western capitalism and 1980s pop cliches to embrace visual motifs and cultural artifacts associated with socialism and Eastern Europe, along with the vibrant tropes of 1990s rave culture.
