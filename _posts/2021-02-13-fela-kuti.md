Fela Kuti is an immensely important musician, both culturally and historically. He was a Nigerian instrumentalist and political activist who pioneered Afrobeat by mixing Apala music, funk, jazz, highlife, salsa, calypso, and traditional Yoruba music. His music is vibrant and energetic.

Here’s one of my favorites, from 1977:

For a more modern spin on one of his works, here’s Newen Afrobeat's cover of "Opposite People," from 2017. This performance features Seun Kuti, the youngest son of Fela Kuti. Seun Kuti also leads his father's former band Egypt 80:

Some trivia: Fela Kuti famously had 28 wives. He also had 7 children.

Here's an interesting wikipedia article about Kalakuta Republic, a communal compound that housed his family, band members, and recording studio before being destroyed by a thousand armed soldiers: [Kalakuta Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalakuta_Republic)
