Elsiane is a Canadian duo that blends trip-hop, downtempo, and electronica, featuring the talented vocals of Elsieanne Caplette and the innovative sounds of Stephane Sotto. I've been listening to their music since high school, ever since it was featurured in a sci-fi webcomic called Ava's Demon.

Here are two songs from their their 2012 album Mechanics of Emotion:
