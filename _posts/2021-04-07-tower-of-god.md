*Tower of God* is an anime adaptation of the popular webtoon by SIU. The story follows a boy named Bam as he ascends a mysterious tower, encountering various challenges and characters along the way.

The original soundtrack, composed by Kevin Penkin, is primarily electronic. This soundtrack incorporates elements from genres like glitch, IDM, dark ambient, and post-industrial.

Hereâ€™s my favorite track from the full OST, timestamped:
