Hiatus Kaiyote is an Australian jazz/funk band formed in Melbourne in 2011, made up of singer/guitarist Nai Palm, bassist Paul Bender, keyboardist Simon Mavin, and drummer Perrin Moss. The band takes influence from neo-soul, future soul, jazz-funk, and could be considered "blue-eyed soul", a term describing R&B and soul music performed by white artists.
