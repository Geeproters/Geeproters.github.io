Hiatus Kaiyote is a Melbourne-based Australian band formed in 2011, blending jazz, funk, neo-soul, and future soul. The group features singer/guitarist Nai Palm, bassist Paul Bender, keyboardist Simon Mavin, and drummer Perrin Moss. Their sound often draws comparisons to “blue-eyed soul,” a term traditionally used for R&B and soul music performed by white artists, highlighting their unique place in contemporary soul music.

A standout track showcasing their lush arrangements and groove.
