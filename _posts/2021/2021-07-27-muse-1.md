The reason why some albums have "(Japanese Edition)" after them is usually the following: Traditionally, within Japan, CDs and LPs have been expensive enough (apparently because the distribution chain of CDs in Japan involves many middlemen, which drives up the cost of production) that it was cheaper for a Japanese music fan to import CDs from elsewhere That led to the birth of the "bonus tracks", where domestic Japanese pressings would have some bonus material available, over what was available in the rest of the world. This was in the hope that Japanese fans would see merit in doling out that extra yen for any album, and they would buy the more expensive local pressing than the cheaper import.
