Muse is an English alternative rock band from Teignmouth, Devon, formed in 1994. They've won numerous awards, including Grammys for Best Rock Album in 2011 and 2016. Their sound draws inspiration from progressive metal and R&B/soul, and they are known for their melancholic style and lead vocalist Matt Bellamy's distinctive falsetto.

The reason some albums have "(Japanese Edition)" after them is usually this: Traditionally in Japan, CDs and LPs have been expensive due to the complex distribution chain involving many middlemen. This led to domestic Japanese pressings including bonus tracks not found elsewhere, encouraging fans to buy the pricier local version instead of cheaper imports.
