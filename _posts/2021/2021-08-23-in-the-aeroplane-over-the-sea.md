"In the Aeroplane Over the Sea is the second album released by American rock band Neutral Milk Hotel, released on February 10, 1998. The music is predominantly indie rock and psychedelic folk. Characterized by an intentionally low-quality sound." Makes use of some less conventional instruments such as a singing saw, zanzithophone, and uilleann pipes. Also noise. The album received critical acclaim after gaining a cult following and is described by music journalists as a landmark album for indie rock and as one of the best albums of the 1990s.

Anne Frank and her life were a major influence during the writing of many of the lyrics. As such, many consider it a concept album.
