*In the Aeroplane Over the Sea* is the second album by American rock band Neutral Milk Hotel, released on February 10, 1998. The music blends indie rock and psychedelic folk, featuring an intentionally lo-fi sound that adds a raw, intimate feel. The album incorporates unconventional instruments such as the singing saw, zanzithophone, and uilleann pipes, along with noise elements that contribute to its unique texture.

The album received critical acclaim after developing a cult following and is widely regarded by music journalists as a landmark indie rock album and one of the best of the 1990s. Anne Frank and her life heavily influenced the lyrics, leading many to consider it a concept album.
