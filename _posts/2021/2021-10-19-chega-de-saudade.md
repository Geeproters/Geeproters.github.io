Often cited as the first bossa nova recording, “Chega de Saudade” (“No More Blues”) helped define the genre’s understated rhythm and harmonic sophistication. Composed by Antônio Carlos Jobim with lyrics by Vinícius de Moraes, it’s a cornerstone of Brazilian music and a global jazz standard.

João Gilberto’s 1958 recording introduced the song’s quiet syncopation and guitar style, establishing a new vocabulary for popular Brazilian music. Decades later, Jobim revisited the piece on *Inédito* (1987), offering a reflective interpretation with fuller orchestration. A third version, by Yo-Yo Ma and Rosa Passos, reframes the song through classical phrasing and intimate vocal-guitar interplay—demonstrating the piece’s adaptability across genres.
