Katana 0 is a 2D action platform video game released in April 18, 2019, developed by Askiisoft and published by Devolver Digital. One of my favorite games. It takes place in a dystopic, neo-noir setting with cyberpunk influences in the world and story, and the game's soundtrack represents that with EDM, jazz, and electronica. Some great tracks from a great game:
 All for Now
