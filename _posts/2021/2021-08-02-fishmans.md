Fishmans were a Japanese band formed in 1987 in Minato, Tokyo. They are known for their unique psychedelic sound, the distinctive vocals of the late lead singer Shinji Sato, the dynamic drumming of Kin-Ichi Motegi, and the rocksteady basslines of Yuzuru Kashiwabara.  

"Long Season" is their sixth studio album, first released on October 25, 1996. It consists of a single 35-minute composition based on the band's earlier song "Season," blending dream pop, dub, neo-psychedelia, progressive pop, ambient pop, and minimalism.
