A collaboration between Alex Koenig (Nmesh) and Luke Laurila (t e l e p a t h テレパシー能力者), *ロストエデンへのパス* is a two-part ambient electronica album steeped in vaporwave aesthetics. Side A, guided by Nmesh, presents a surreal, sample-heavy voyage, while Side B shifts into dreamlike territory under t e l e p a t h’s control. The album explores memory, fantasy, and synthetic nostalgia through expansive, slow-moving textures.

Full album featuring both artists, split into two thematic halves.

A timestamped entry into t e l e p a t h’s side, rich with drifting pads and distant echoes.
