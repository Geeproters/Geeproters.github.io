Emily King is an American singer-songwriter who blends R&B, soul, and reggae influences into her smooth, heartfelt sound. I first discovered her through a song she performed for *Steven Universe*, which perfectly showcases her warm, expressive voice.

King has earned multiple Grammy nominations: Best Contemporary R&B Album (2007), Best R&B Song and Best Engineered Album for *Scenery* (2019), and Best R&B Performance for "See Me" (2020).

Here are some great tracks to get started:
