This is a great jazz fusion cover of my favorite track from a previous recommendation (post 37). Jazz fusion blends jazz improvisation with rock, funk, and R&B rhythms, often featuring electric instruments and complex time signatures. This cover brings a fresh, energetic take on the original piece by Pilotredsun.
