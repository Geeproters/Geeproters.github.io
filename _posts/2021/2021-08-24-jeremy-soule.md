Among other controversies in the past, it appears Bethesda has cut professional ties with Soule after he was accused of sexual misconduct/inappropriate behavior by two women. Despite that, his raw musical talent and the quality of his work are both almost indisputable. Thus, it serves as a good example of when it should be considered whether morally you should or shouldn't be able to separate the art from the artist.
