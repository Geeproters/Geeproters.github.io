Sovietwave is a microgenre, a subgenre of synthwave music and accompanying Internet aesthetic which originates from the former Soviet Union, primarily Russia. It is characterized by an emphasis on the technology and culture of the Soviet Union, such as the Soviet space program and retrofuturistic Soviet era architecture and art, and is an expression of nostalgia for the Soviet Union. 

Linguist Maria Engstr√∂m described Sovietwave as the post-Soviet counterpart to vaporwave, evoking a similar nostalgic critique of the "contemporary collapse of futurity" and longing for the lost optimism of a bygone era. 

The genre often incorporates samples of speeches, news broadcasts, and other audio artifacts.

This one-hour compilation, [1 Hour Of Melancholic Sovietwave](https://youtu.be/Ya3XufguZMY), encapsulates the essence of the genre quite well.
