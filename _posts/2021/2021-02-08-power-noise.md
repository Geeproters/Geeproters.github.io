Here's some Power Noise, a form of industrial music and a fusion of noise music and various styles of electronic dance music characterized by its harsh sound and relentless rhythmic structures.

The first track takes a little while to really get going. Here's INCINERATOR, featured on DREAMCRUSHER's 2016 EP Dreamcrusher:

This next track is easier to get into. It's harsh but contains melodic ideas that are more discernible, with a slightly less chaotic structure. Here's a track from Five Star Hotel's 2019 album Gray Data:

Power noise is not to be confused with "harsh noise wall", an extreme subgenre that is "a literal consistent, unflinching and enveloping wall of monolithic noise" as described by music journalist Russell Williams.
