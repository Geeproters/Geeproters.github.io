Shibuya-kei is a microgenre of pop music or a general aesthetic that flourished in the mid to late 1990s. It emerged as Japanese retail music from the Shibuya district of Tokyo; artists purveyed a cut-and-paste style that was inspired by previous genres based on kitsch, fusion, and artifice The genre was initially influenced by the french Yé-Yé movement. Nowadays it incorporates elements from lounge jazz and bossa nova. This compilation album, "Sushi 3003-: 
A Spectacular Collection of Japanese Clubpop", is a good presentation of Japanese club/lounge pop from a mish-mash of influences, particularly pop electronica and Shibuya-kei.
