Shibuya-kei is a microgenre of pop music or a general aesthetic that flourished in the mid to late 1990s. It emerged as Japanese retail music from the Shibuya district of Tokyo; artists purveyed a cut-and-paste style inspired by earlier genres based on kitsch, fusion, and artifice. The genre was initially influenced by the French Yé-Yé movement, and over time incorporated elements from lounge jazz, bossa nova, and electronic music.

This 1996 compilation album is a great showcase of the styles of Japanese club pop, Shibuya-kei, and pop electronica:
