Post-Industrial / Art Pop album from Ada Rook (under "rook"), with elements of glitch pop, industrial rock, and electroclash. Timestamped at my favorite track.

Industrial music as a genre emerged out of Punk and avant-garde art movements in the mid-1970s, often characterized by a bleak, mechanical atmosphere, the use of metallic percussion as well as other unconventional instruments, and extensive use of sampling influenced by Musique concr√®te. Post-industrial generally takes the dark and mechanical aesthetic of early industrial, and combines it with more accessible genres, such as Rock or EDM.
