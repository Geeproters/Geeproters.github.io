A standout track from *rook*, Ada Rook’s Post-Industrial / Art Pop project, *shed blood* fuses glitch pop, industrial rock, and electroclash. Featured on her *Everlasting Summer* album, the track highlights her distinct approach to layered electronic textures and emotionally raw composition.

Industrial music first emerged in the mid-1970s from Punk and avant-garde art movements, defined by its bleak, mechanical atmospheres, metallic percussion, and heavy sampling influenced by Musique Concrète. *Post-industrial* builds on these foundations but incorporates more accessible elements from Rock and EDM, resulting in a broader sonic palette.
