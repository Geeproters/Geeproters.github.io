Tera Melos is an American math rock band from Sacramento, California, formed in 2004. Their music incorporates a range of rock styles, and unconventional song structures. While each album has a distinct feel, often drawing from punk, indie, prog, noise, or post-rock, their sound is consistently intense, abrasive, and experimental.

Here are my two favorite albums from them:

[Tera Melos - Trash Generator (2017)](https://youtu.be/uRYH7kxg210)  

[Tera Melos - Patagonian Rats (2010) FULL ALBUM](https://youtu.be/S2QsZ75ESuk)
