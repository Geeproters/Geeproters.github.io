Injury Reserve is an American hip hop group from Tempe, Arizona, formed in 2013 by rappers Stepa J. Groggs, Ritchie with a T, and producer Parker Corey. Their sound blends alternative hip hop, jazz rap, experimental, and abstract styles, with rich sampling and creative voice modulation.

Hereâ€™s their 2021 album *By the Time I Get to Phoenix*, showcasing inventive production and genre-blending beats.

One standout track, *Top Picks for You*, starts at 21:18 and is among my personal favorite hip hop tracks ever.
