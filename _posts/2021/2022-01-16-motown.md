Motown, or the Motown sound, emerged in the 1960s as a defining force in rhythm and blues. Named after the Detroit-based record company, Motown specialized in polished, soulful productions crafted by teams of songwriters and musicians for girl groups, boy bands, and solo singers. The label transformed from a small independent operation into the largest Black-owned enterprise in the U.S., competing nationally in the music industry.

Marvin Gaye, often called the *Prince of Motown* and *Prince of Soul*, played a key role in shaping its sound. Beginning as an in-house session musician, he later gained success as a solo artist with a string of influential hits.

The Supremes—later *Diana Ross & The Supremes*—were Motown’s most successful girl group and one of the most popular acts of the 20th century, rivaling even The Beatles. Diana Ross, Florence Ballard, and Mary Wilson signed with the label as teenagers in 1961.
