A standout track from lo-fi hip-hop producer and orchestral composer Seycara (Yuang Chen), *Butterfly Bossa* blends laid-back jazz harmonies with serene electronic textures. Featured on the 2020 album *Everlasting Summer*, the piece embodies Seycaraâ€™s signature fusion of cinematic orchestration and chilled beats.
