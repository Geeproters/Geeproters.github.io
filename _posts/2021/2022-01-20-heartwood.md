The whole album is great and of a consistently high quality. Mostly acoustic covers: generally piano, strings and woodwind instruments like clarinets and oboes, with more interesting instruments like the pan flute(?) featured in Ryube Village. Most of the songs have a kind of foresty woodland vibe, which suits the title.
