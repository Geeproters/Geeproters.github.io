*Heartwood* is a 2021 album featuring video game music covers, created by GameGrooves (known for the *Breath of the Wild* lo-fi remix albums) and a collective of musicians under *Pixel Mixers*. The album offers high-quality acoustic renditions, incorporating piano, strings, and woodwinds—such as clarinets, oboes, and even a pan flute in *Ryube Village*. Most tracks evoke a serene, woodland atmosphere, fitting the album’s title.

The album features 15 tracks from 24 artists, covering music from *Chrono Trigger*, *Octopath Traveler*, *Trials of Mana*, *Xenoblade Chronicles*, *Final Fantasy X*, and more. 100% of proceeds go to Rainforest Trust.
