Douglas Appling, (aka Emancipator), is an American producer and DJ based in Portland, Oregon. He makes Electronica and electronic music, especially Downtempo, Trip hop, Chill-out music, Ambient music, Instrumental, and EDM. His music has a cool style that fits studying and relaxation. Here's my favorite album by him, Baralku (2017), timestamped at my favorite track.
