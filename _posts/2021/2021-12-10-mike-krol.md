Mike Krol is a Los Angeles-based musician whose garage rock output blends punk energy with blown-out production and sardonic lyrics. Originally a graphic designer, Krol began self-releasing music in the early 2010s, eventually signing with Merge Records. His sound favors brevity—distorted riffs, shouted hooks, and songs that rarely pass the two-minute mark.

Noisy and grungy.
