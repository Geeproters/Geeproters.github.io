Bebop is a subgenre of jazz characterized by fast tempos, virtuosic technique, and advanced harmonies. It arose in the early 1940s, and due to its experimental nature and fast pace (making it non-danceable), it wasn't initially popular with a majority audience. Some consider the arisal and popularization of bebop as a shift from jazz as entertainment to jazz as an intellectual art form. Charles Parker Jr., nicknamed "Bird" and "Yardbird," was an American jazz alto saxophonist, bandleader, and composer. Charlie Parker was a highly influential soloist and leading figure in the development of bebop.
