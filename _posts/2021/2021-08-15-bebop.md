Bebop marked a turning point in jazz—fast, harmonically dense, and designed for listening rather than dancing. Emerging in the 1940s, it challenged the conventions of big band swing, emphasizing improvisation, complex chord changes, and breakneck tempos.

Charlie Parker, also known as "Bird," was a foundational force in this movement. His phrasing, harmonic innovations, and sheer speed on the alto saxophone reshaped jazz forever and paved the way for generations of modern players.
