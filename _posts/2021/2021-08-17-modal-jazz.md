Modal jazz is jazz that makes use of musical modes often modulating among them to accompany the chords instead of relying on one tonal center used across the piece. It arose during the mid-50s. William John "Bill" Evans was an American jazz pianist and composer who mostly worked as the leader of a trio. His use of impressionist harmony, interpretation of traditional jazz repertoire, block chords, and trademark rhythmically independent, "singing" melodic lines continue to influence jazz pianists today. In 1955, he moved to New York City, where he worked with bandleader and theorist George Russell (considered one of the first jazz musicians to contribute to general music theory with a theory of harmony based on jazz rather than European music). In 1958, Evans joined Miles Davis's sextet, which in 1959, then immersed in modal jazz, recorded Kind of Blue, the best-selling jazz album ever. Since I don't like that album very much though, here are some good tracks from Bill Evans Trio:
