Modal jazz emerged in the mid-1950s, favoring scales and modes as the basis for improvisation rather than complex chord progressions. This shift allowed for a more open, spacious form of jazz—less tethered to rapid harmonic changes, and more attuned to mood and color.

Bill Evans, a deeply introspective pianist, became one of the genre’s most influential figures. His work blended modal ideas with lush impressionist harmonies and delicate, lyrical phrasing. Though often associated with *Kind of Blue* (which he played on), Evans’s trio recordings reflect a more intimate and nuanced application of modal jazz.
