Pavel Grigorievich Chesnokov (1877 – 1944) was an Imperial Russian and Soviet composer, choral conductor and teacher. He composed over five hundred choral works, over four hundred of which are sacred (liturgical). In his youth, during his years studying at The Moscow Conservatory (a musical educational institution located in Moscow), he had the opportunity to study with other prominent Russian composers like Sergei Taneyev and Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov, who greatly influence his style of liturgy-driven choral composition. Often, choral composers make use of lower notes, such as G1 or even F1, but in rare cases the choir relies on exceptionally deep-ranged bassi profondi (termed oktavists or octavists), who sometimes sing an octave below the bass part. This was especially typical of Russian Orthodox choral music. Basso profondo, sometimes basso profundo or contrabass, is the bass voice subtype with the lowest vocal range. Here are some of Chesnokov's compositions featuring such parts:

Here's another recording of Pasyukov. Incredible voice.

Here's a piece with 3 basso profondo in the choir's formation (very evenly spread, so volume should be up). The composition is by Alexei Fyodorovich Lvov (1798 - 1870), who also composed the imperial Russian national anthem.

"Salvation is Created" is a choral work composed by Tchesnokov in 1912 as the fifth in his Ten Communion Hymns (opus 25). It was one of the last sacred works he composed before he turned to secular arts, when the Soviet government began to suppress Christianity. Although he never heard his own composition performed, his children had the opportunity following his death. Here's a performance of it by my favorite vocal group, VOCES8:
