Pavel Grigorievich Chesnokov (1877–1944) was a Russian and Soviet composer and choral conductor, known for over 500 choral works, most of them sacred. Studying at the Moscow Conservatory, he was influenced by composers like Sergei Taneyev. Russian Orthodox choral music often features basso profondos—bass singers with exceptionally low vocal ranges, sometimes singing an octave below the bass.

"Salvation is Created" (1912) by Chesnokov is a late sacred work composed before Soviet suppression of Christianity. Although he never heard his own composition performed, his children had the opportunity following his death. This performance is by VOCES8:
