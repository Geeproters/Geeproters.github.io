Since I Left You is the debut album released by Australian electronic group the Avalanches in November 2000. The album is a mix of EDM, hip hop, and plunderphonics. Plunderphonics is a music genre in which tracks are constructed by sampling recognizable musical works. The term was coined by composer John Oswald in 1985 in his essay "Plunderphonics, or Audio Piracy as a Compositional Prerogative". The full album is around an hour long, and according to Robbie Chater, used about 900 samples.

We Will Always Love You is the third studio album from Australian electronic group the Avalanches, released December 2020. The album is primarily psychedelia, sampledelia, and pop, it's less in the vein of plunderphonics than their previous albums. Sampledelia features "disorienting, perception-warping" manipulations of audio samples or found sounds via techniques such as chopping, looping or stretching.
