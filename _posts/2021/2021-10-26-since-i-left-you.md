*Since I Left You* (2000) is the debut album by Australian electronic group The Avalanches. It’s a landmark in plunderphonics—a genre defined by composer John Oswald in 1985 as music built from recognizable samples repurposed into new compositions. The album runs about an hour and reportedly uses around 900 samples, blending EDM and hip hop into a seamless collage.

Their third album, *We Will Always Love You* (2020), shifts toward psychedelia and sampledelia. Sampledelia manipulates audio with chopping, looping, and stretching to create disorienting, perception-warping soundscapes. The album features an impressive list of collaborators including Blood Orange, Rivers Cuomo, Tricky, Leon Bridges, and Jamie xx, expanding its sonic palette.
