The Secret of Monkey Island is a classic adventure game known for its humor and memorable soundtrack. 

Here are two different renditions of the game's intro theme to compare.

First, the original PC Speaker theme, which showcases the limitations of early computer sound:

Wikipedia: A PC speaker (Not to be confused with Computer speakers) is a loudspeaker built into some IBM PC compatible computers. The first IBM Personal Computer, model 5150, employed a standard 2.25 inch magnetic driven (dynamic) speaker. More recent computers use a tiny moving-iron or piezo speaker instead. The speaker allows software and firmware to provide auditory feedback to a user, such as to report a hardware fault. A PC speaker generates waveforms using the programmable interval timer, an Intel 8253 or 8254 chip. The PC speaker is normally meant to reproduce a square wave via only 2 levels of output, which limits its ability to create complex audio. It generates sound waves directly, often resulting in beeping or buzzing tones.

In contrast, the Roland MT-32 version is richer and more nuanced:

Wikipedia: The Roland MT-32 Multi-Timbre Sound Module is a MIDI synthesizer module first released in 1987. It was originally marketed to amateur musicians as a budget external synthesizer with an original list price of $695 (equivalent to $1,860 in 2023). It became more famous along with its compatible modules as an early de facto standard in computer music. Since it was made prior to the release of the General MIDI standard, it uses its own proprietary format for MIDI file playback.
