L.W. is the seventeenth studio album by Australian psychedelic rock band King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard, officially released on 25 February 2021. KGLW is a band that finds itself constantly reinventing its own sound. This recent album shows that their music remains as fresh as its always been. This album in particular makes a lot of use of microtonality, disharmony, and alternative music modes and scales, and lots of interesting instrumentation. "See Me" is my favorite track off the album.
