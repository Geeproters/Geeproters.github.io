*L.W.* is the seventeenth studio album by Australian psychedelic rock band King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard, released in February 2021. Known for their genre-hopping and inventive approach, the band explores microtonality, dissonance, and alternative scales extensively on this record. The album also features diverse instrumentation, adding to its experimental texture.

“See Me” stands out as a highlight with its dynamic shifts and layered sound design.
