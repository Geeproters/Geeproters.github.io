Phantasmagoria is an LP by Australian electronic producer/DJ Mr. Bill. His music is an interesting mix of a bunch of subgenres and influences, combining elements of dubstep, trap, ‎IDM‎, chillstep, hardwave, ambient, sound collage, glitch, etc. The album is, for the most part, very atmospheric and texturally focused with a lot of intricate sound design.
