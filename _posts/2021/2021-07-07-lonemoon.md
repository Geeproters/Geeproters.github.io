LoneMoon is an electronic music producer who first gained traction on SoundCloud around 2013. Early tracks were shaped by artists like Deadmau5 and Madeon, but also drew from gospel, 80s pop, smooth jazz, and classical music heard on the radio.

The sound blends clean electronic textures with unpredictable structures and genre-shifting ideas.
