It's been 300 full days since the start of doing this in December of 2020. I've talked about most of my favorite artists, albums and tracks, from dozens of genres, subgenres, and microgenres, from movies, games, and anime, and from a bunch of different countries. To keep finding interesting music, I'll keep on doing it. 
Next: 3 similar subgenres of heavy metal.
