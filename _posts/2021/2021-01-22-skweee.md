Skweee is a genre that emerged in Sweden and Finland in the late 2000s, characterized by its blend of simple synth and chiptune melodies paired with funk, R&B, and soul-like rhythms. While most tracks in this genre are instrumental, there are notable exceptions that feature vocal elements.

One example of this sound is "Swedish Pommak" by Limonious, which showcases the playful and quirky essence of Skweee.

It's a pretty niche genre. If you're interested in exploring more music in this vein, chiptune and electronica with synth influences might be your best bet.
