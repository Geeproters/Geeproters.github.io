Québec-born pianist Jean-Michel Blais blends classical tradition with minimalist texture in a way that feels both intimate and expansive.

Blais emerged from Montreal’s vibrant music scene with a background shaped by Chopin, Ravel, and Rachmaninoff, but also by modern peers like Chilly Gonzales and Yann Tiersen. His work often explores the intersection of structured composition and emotional improvisation. The result: pieces that ripple with motion but never lose their clarity.

Layered and delicate, this piece builds gradually—rich in dynamic contrast and textural nuance.

A modern take on the 18th-century dance form (passepied roughly means “pass-foot”), Blais keeps things elegant but alive.
