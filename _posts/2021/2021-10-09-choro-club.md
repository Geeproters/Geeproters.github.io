More Japanese choro music. Choro Club shares their guitarist, Shigeharu Sasago with the previous choro trio I mentioned, ko-ko-ya. Choro Club (formed in 1989) as a band have been around longer than ko-ko-ya (formed in 2004). The trio also consists of double-bassist Jyoji Sawada, along with bandolim performer Oh Akioka.
