inabakumori (formerly きゐな) is a Japanese vocaloid producer who mainly uses Kaai Yuki (don’t google it). After sharing a few Miku tracks recently, here are a couple featuring Yuki’s voice:

Kaai Yuki was released in 2007 with the Yamaha synthesizer software VOCALOID2, part of a long evolution in vocal synthesis. The original VOCALOID1 (2004) was designed as a replacement for real singers but was soon replaced by VOCALOID2 (2007), which used vocal samples and encouraged stylistic use rather than imitation.  

VOCALOID3 (2011) expanded the software with new features and languages. VOCALOID4 (2014) saw many VOCALOID2 voices relaunched due to Windows 10 compatibility issues, sometimes requiring new voice providers.  

VOCALOID5 (2018) is the latest version, supporting multiple languages including Japanese, English, Korean, Spanish, and Mandarin. Despite this, vocaloid songs appear in many languages, like this Italian example:
