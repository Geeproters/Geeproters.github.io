inabakumori (formerly known as きゐな) is a Japanese vocaloid producer. He mainly uses Kaai Yuki (don't google it). I think I've just done songs featuring Miku, so here are a couple of inabakumori's, which feature Yuki:

Like Hatsune Miku and Rin & Len Kagamine, Kaai Yuki was released in 2007 with the Yamaha synthesizer application VOCALOID2. 


The first iteration of the software, "VOCALOID1" was developed by the YAMAHA Corporation and released in January 15, 2004. Considered the brainchild of Kenmochi Hideki. The original intention of V1 was to act as a replacement singer for a real singer. It was discontinued with the advent of VOCALOID2. 


VOCALOID2 (released June 29, 2007) succeeded the original engine. It based its output on vocal samples, rather than voice analysis. Also, with V2, the software saw some departure from the original intent of the program of acting as a replacement singer, but instead encouraged intentional usage as a stylistic choice. Unsupported as of the release of VOCALOID3.


VOCALOID3 (released October 21, 2011) was a much more expansive version of the previous software, containing many new features, three new languages, and many more vocals than the past software versions combined. Released, but replaced with VOCALOID4. 


With VOCALOID4 (released December 17, 2014), due to the impact Windows 10 had on maintaining the VOCALOID2 software, AH-Software decided to relaunch every VOCALOID2 vocal they had produced as a VOCALOID4 vocal. For some voices, such as with the provider of Kaai Yuki, because the voice actor would likely be of middle or highschool age, re-sampling her voice for growl samples was a problem. It was decided to find a second voice provider for the purpose. Released, but replaced with VOCALOID5.


VOCALOID5 (released July 12, 2018) is the current successor to the V4 engine. Currently, vocal languages with built-in voicebanks include Japanese, English, Korean, Spanish, and Mandarin. However, it's not hard to find vocaloid songs in other languages:
