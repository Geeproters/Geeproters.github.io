Future Bass emerged in the 2010s as a more melodic, uplifting branch of EDM—keeping the energy of dubstep and trap, but swapping aggression for shimmering synths and emotional progressions. It often features sidechained chords, wobbly detuned leads, and punchy vocal chops, delivering a sound that’s both intense and euphoric.

The genre has become especially popular in Japan’s electronic scene, influencing artists like PSYQUI and Snail’s House.
