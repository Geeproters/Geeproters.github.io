Free jazz is an experimental subgenre of jazz that breaks away from traditional structures like steady tempos, fixed chord changes, and predictable harmonies. It emerged in the late 1950s and early 1960s as musicians sought complete freedom in improvisation and expression.

One of the genre’s landmark albums is John Coltrane’s *A Love Supreme* (1965), a deeply spiritual and intense work that pushes the boundaries of jazz with its raw emotional power and innovative improvisation.
