Gary Burton is an American jazz vibraphonist, composer, and educator known for developing a pianistic four-mallet technique, which revolutionized vibraphone playing and influenced many musicians.

Patrick Bruce "Pat" Metheny is an American jazz guitarist and composer, leader of the Pat Metheny Group. His style blends progressive jazz, contemporary jazz, Latin jazz, and jazz fusion.

Roy Owen Haynes is an American jazz drummer with nearly 80 years of experience. He has played across swing, bebop, jazz fusion, and avant-garde jazz, and is considered a pioneer of jazz drumming. His nickname in the 1950s was "Snap Crackle."

Dave Holland is an English jazz double bassist, composer, and bandleader known for his work ranging from solo performances to big band compositions over five decades.

Armando Anthony "Chick" Corea was an American jazz composer, keyboardist, and bandleader whose compositions like "Spain," "500 Miles High," and "La Fiesta" are considered jazz standards.

Like Minds is a 1998 collaborative jazz album featuring these five legends. It won the 1999 Grammy Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance, Individual or Group.

Metheny’s guitar and Burton’s vibraphone stand out, but all five musicians are legendary figures in an era defined by stylistic pluralism, where no single jazz style dominates.
