Gary Burton is an American jazz vibraphonist, composer, and educator. Burton developed a pianistic style of the four-mallet technique as an alternative to the prevailing two-mallet technique. This approach caused him to be heralded as an innovator, with a widely imitated sound. 
Patrick Bruce "Pat" Metheny is an American jazz guitarist and composer. He is the leader of the Pat Metheny Group and is also involved in duets, solo works, and other side projects. His style incorporates elements of progressive and contemporary jazz, Latin jazz, and jazz fusion. 
Roy Owen Haynes is an American jazz drummer. He is among the most recorded drummers in jazz. In a career lasting nearly 80 years, he has played swing, bebop, jazz fusion, avant-garde jazz, and is considered a pioneer of jazz drumming. "Snap Crackle" was a nickname given to him in the 1950s. 
Dave Holland is an English jazz double bassist, composer, and bandleader who has been performing and recording for five decades. His work ranges from pieces for solo performances to big bands. 
Armando Anthony "Chick" Corea was an American jazz composer, keyboardist, bandleader, and occasional percussionist. His compositions "Spain", "500 Miles High", "La Fiesta", "Armando's Rhumba" and "Windows" are widely considered jazz standards. 
Like Minds is a 1998 jazz album by these five. In 1999, the album won a Grammy Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance, Individual or Group.

Metheny's guitar and Burton's vibraphone are the highlights for me, but all 5 are/were legendary jazz musicians - even in this era characterized by a pluralism in which no one style dominates, but rather a wide range of styles and genres are popular.
