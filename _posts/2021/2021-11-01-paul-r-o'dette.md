Paul R. O'Dette is a distinguished American lutenist, conductor, and musicologist renowned for his expertise in Renaissance and Baroque music performance. With over 120 recordings to his name, O'Dette has received five Grammy nominations and numerous prestigious awards, solidifying his reputation as one of the foremost interpreters of early music.

This performance features the *Complete Lute Galliards Works* and *Lachrimae* by John Dowland (1563â€“1626), a seminal composer of the Elizabethan era whose melancholic and expressive lute compositions remain foundational in the lute repertoire.
