The pipa, often referred to as the "Chinese lute," is a traditional four-stringed instrument with a history dating back over 2000 years. It has evolved significantly throughout history, with influences from Persian and Central Asian music. The pipa features a pear-shaped wooden body and is played by plucking its strings with the fingers, producing a unique, resonant sound characterized by rapid-fire notes and intricate ornamentation. 

Wikipedia: The name "pipa" is made up of two Chinese syllables, "pí" (琵) and "pá" (琶). These, according to the Han dynasty text by Liu Xi, refer to the way the instrument is played – "pí" is to strike outward with the right hand, and "pá" is to pluck inward towards the palm of the hand.

Historically, the pipa has been associated with both folk and classical music, serving as an accompaniment for solo performances, ensembles, and even opera. Its repertoire is rich, ranging from lyrical melodies to virtuosic pieces that showcase its expressive capabilities.

This song, "Blue Pipa," quotes the same progression as "All Blues" from Miles Davis, blending traditional and contemporary elements.
