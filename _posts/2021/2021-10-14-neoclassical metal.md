Neoclassical Metal bridges the virtuosity of Baroque composition with the speed and distortion of late 20th-century metal.

Emerging in the late 1970s, the genre draws heavily from European classical music—particularly Paganini, Bach, and Vivaldi—while retaining the aggression and tone of speed metal. Deep Purple’s Ritchie Blackmore is often credited with laying the groundwork, but it was guitarists like Yngwie Malmsteen who codified the style: rapid scalar runs, harmonic minor modes, and a near-soloist conception of guitar technique. The subgenre peaked in the 1980s, aligning with the rise of shred guitar and instructional culture.
