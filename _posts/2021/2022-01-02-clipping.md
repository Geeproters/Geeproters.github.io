Clipping. is an experimental hip hop group from Los Angeles known for blending industrial hip hop and noise rap elements. Their abrasive, unconventional sound challenges traditional hip hop with heavy distortion, aggressive rhythms, and intense vocal delivery.

Formed in 2009, clipping. pushes genre boundaries by mixing harsh noise textures with rapid-fire lyrics. Their 2016 EP *Wriggle* showcases this approach, layering abrasive beats with confrontational storytelling. The track “Say the Name” highlights their fusion of noise and rhythm, while “Nothing Is Safe” delivers unsettling soundscapes matching the aggressive vocal style.

One of their most popular songs, “Work Work (feat. Cocc Pistol Cree),” gained attention for raw energy and intense production, exemplifying the group’s experimental ethos. Clipping.’s work isn’t mainstream-friendly, but has a dedicated following for fearless sound exploration.
