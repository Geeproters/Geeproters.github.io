Claude Debussy's "The Girl with the Flaxen Hair" ("La fille aux cheveux de lin") is one of his most famous piano preludes, composed in 1910. The piece is known for its simple, lyrical melody and impressionistic harmonies that evoke a gentle, pastoral mood. 

Here it is beautifully arranged and performed by the SAKURA cello quintet:
