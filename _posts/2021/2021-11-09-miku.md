Here are a couple of 2010s era vocaloid songs featuring Miku:
 ATOLS - MACARON feat. Hatsune Miku / マカロン feat. 初音ミク

 Miku Hatsune - Chaining Intention -Music Video-
https://youtu.be/J8SYrzDHD74 (2010) Vocaloid technology has improved a lot since then, and there are now programs where you almost can't distinguish between simulated voice from real. Regardless, both the older and newer styles remain popular.


Along with the two previously mentioned songs, I made some mixes of other songs with vocaloid in the left ear and a real singer's (Isekai Joucho) cover in the right ear, to be able to hear the differences between the vocaloid and a real voice simultaneously.
 Kikuo & Isekai Joucho - [Hole Dwelling] mix

 Kikuo & Isekai Joucho - [The Cat's Dining Table] mix
