India’s classical music tradition features a rich variety of instruments, each with a deep cultural and historical lineage. Among the most iconic are the sitar, tabla, and bansuri.

The **sitar** is a plucked string instrument prominent in Hindustani (North Indian) classical music. It evolved from the Persian setar and was refined over centuries. With its sympathetic strings and complex resonance, the sitar gained international fame in the 20th century, especially through virtuosos like Ravi Shankar, who introduced it to Western audiences.

The **tabla** is a pair of hand-played drums used widely in classical, devotional, and popular music. Originating in the Indian subcontinent during the 18th century, it is known for its rhythmic precision and expressive capabilities. Tabla players, like Zakir Hussain, have brought the instrument to global stages.

The **bansuri** is a bamboo transverse flute associated with pastoral life and the Hindu god Krishna. One of the oldest musical instruments in India, it produces a soft, meditative tone and is used in both classical and folk traditions.
