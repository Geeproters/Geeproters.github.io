Paul Lansky is an American composer, and among the first to experiment with the computer for sound synthesis back in the mid-1960s. Sounds originating from "real-world" sources are the predominant focus of Lansky's computer music: traffic, kids in the kitchen, musical instruments, and especially speech. Electronic synthesis is frequently used but the main sonic resources are transformations of recorded natural sounds. Here's one of the tracks from his album "More Than Idle Chatter." Released 1994, It's a good example of post-minimalism (ie. pushing repetitive natures and use of static harmonies a step further than minimalism), and Electroacoustic music (Experimental manipulation of acoustically-played ("unplugged") music with Experimental Electronic ("plugged") techniques such as loops, feedback, and layering)

While I'd normally recommend listening to the full 58-minute album to hear some interesting self-contained musical evolutions between tracks, due to the album's post-minimalistic nature, I'm sure most people would just find it pretty boring.
