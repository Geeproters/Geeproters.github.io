Electroacoustic music involves the electronic manipulation and processing of sounds from both acoustic sources, such as field recordings and spoken word, and synthetic ones created through various techniques. It uses effects like looping, layering, crossfading, speed changes, spectral analysis, reverb, and distortion to craft vivid, atmospheric, and often abstract soundscapes.

Originating from tape music, musique concrète, and acousmatic music, electroacoustic music was pioneered by academically trained composers like Karlheinz Stockhausen and Iannis Xenakis. Although grounded in classical composition, it has expanded into experimental and underground styles such as ambient, drone, and noise. Lansky’s music blends these traditions, focusing on texture and sonic exploration rather than traditional song structure or melody.

Paul Lansky is an American composer who was among the first to experiment with computer sound synthesis in the mid-1960s. His work often transforms real-world sounds—like traffic, children, and speech—into electronic textures that blur the line between acoustic and synthetic.

His 1994 album *More Than Idle Chatter* exemplifies post-minimalism and is firmly rooted in electroacoustic music, a genre that shapes much of Lansky’s approach.

While the full album is a slow, immersive journey with gradual evolutions, listeners unfamiliar with post-minimalism might find it repetitive.
