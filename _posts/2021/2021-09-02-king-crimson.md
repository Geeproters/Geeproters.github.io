King Crimson is a highly influential British progressive rock band formed in 1968. Known for their experimental approach, complex compositions, and blending of rock, jazz, classical, and avant-garde music, they helped define and shape the progressive rock genre. Their ever-evolving lineup and innovative use of rhythm and harmony have made them pioneers of progressive music, inspiring countless artists across many genres.

In this King Crimson track, both guitars play the same riff repeatedly, but one guitar omits the last note, placing its pattern in 13/8 time while the other plays in 7/4. This rhythmic displacement causes the parts to phase and desynchronize until they realign, showcasing the band's mastery of complex time signatures and interplay.
