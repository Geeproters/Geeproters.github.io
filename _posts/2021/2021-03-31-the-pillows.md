The Pillows are a Japanese alternative rock band formed in 1989, known outside Japan for their soundtrack work on the *FLCL* OVA series. The group has released 22 studio albums and a string of EPs, compilations, and singles. The *FLCL* soundtrack mixes alternative rock and power pop (Heavier Pop Rock that combines strong Pop melodies with loud power chords, characterized by prominent electric guitars, clear vocals, crisp harmonies, and economical arrangements). It has a distinctive energetic, but often melanchlic sound

Interestingly, the soundtrack actually outlasts the runtime of FLCL the show.
