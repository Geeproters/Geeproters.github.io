Happy new year! Elephant Gym is a math rock and jazz fusion band from Kaohsiung, Taiwan, formed in 2012 by siblings KT Chang and Tell Chang, alongside drummer Chia-Chin Tu. Their name reflects their sound: "elephant" symbolizes bass-driven melodies, while "gym" points to their agile, irregular rhythms.

Their 2016 EP *工作* ("Work") blends warm, lush textures with interesting time signatures without pushing the complexity too far. The fourth track, starting at 8:55, is a personal favorite.
