Happy new year! Elephant Gym is a math rock band and jazz fusion band from Kaohsiung, Taiwan, founded in February 2012. The group consists of siblings KT Chang and Tell Chang and drummer Chia-Chin Tu. The word "elephant" in the band name symbolizes their bass-driven melodies, and "gym" refers to their agile and irregular rhythms. Here's "工作," or "Work," released 2016. A very warm and lush album that doesn't go extreme with the traditional math-rock complexity, but definitely makes use of some really interesting time signatures. The fourth track of the EP is my favorite. Starts at 8:55.
