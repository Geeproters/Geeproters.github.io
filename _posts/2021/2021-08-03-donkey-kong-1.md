Donkey Kong games have always been known for their unusual soundtracks and atmosphere, taking influences from ambient, jazz, and rock'n'roll music. Donkey Kong Country's (1994) soundtrack sticks closest to conventions with its use of swing jazz to underscore its jungle environment:

While those jazz tracks are often the most memorable, this music made up for a very small percentage of the score.

Most of the soundtrack was much more minimalistic or ambient:

Misty Menace and Aquatic Ambience go even further in that direction:

This type of texturally focused and mood-driven music was composed for platforms (SNES, GBA, even the 3DS later) which arguably don't suit the subtlety of these types of compositions. Nowadays, you can find "restored" and uncompressed versions of most of these tracks though, so it doesn't matter.
