Donkey Kong games have always been known for their unusual soundtracks and atmosphere, drawing influences from ambient, jazz, and rock'n'roll music. Donkey Kong Country's (1994) soundtrack sticks closest to conventions with its use of swing jazz to underscore its jungle environment.  

While the jazz tracks are often the most memorable, they make up a small percentage of the overall score.

Most of the soundtrack is much more minimalistic or ambient, creating mood-driven soundscapes:

This texture-focused music was composed for platforms like the SNES, GBA, and later the 3DS, which arguably didnâ€™t fully suit the subtlety of these compositions. Nowadays, restored and uncompressed versions of most tracks are available, preserving their unique atmosphere.
