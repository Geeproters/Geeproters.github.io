This one's pretty different, coming from his first solo album, Water in Time and Space (時空の水, Jikū no Mizu) released in 1989. One of Hirasawa's least electronic works.

The album features a large variety of styles, such as march, orchestral, western, and folk, also apparently influenced by Jungian, New Age, and Andean themes. The album has no particular total concept, which is unlike most of Hirasawa's solo output.
