Electro Swing was my introduction to music beyond mainstream genres. It helped ignite a deeper interest in both electronic music and broader musical landscapes. Caravan Palace remains the standout band in this genre for me. Their recent tracks continue to exemplify their signature blend of vintage swing and modern electronic elements.

Here are two newer releases from Caravan Palace that highlight their evolving sound:
