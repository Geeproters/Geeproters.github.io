Here's an album from Shnabubula, a new-age / neo-classical / jazz / chiptune composer and musician. He often uses chiptune in the form of a simulation of audio hardware using a 16-bit digital sampling system (ie. the SNES). Much of his work could be classified as digital fusion. This album demonstrates a very interesting fusion of real piano over electronic instrumentation. The real instrument and the synthesized ones switch between melody and harmony and create a cool texture that's fun to listen to.
