Shnabubula is a composer blending new-age, neo-classical, jazz, and chiptune elements, often simulating 16-bit audio hardware like the SNES. His work falls under digital fusion, combining acoustic and electronic sounds seamlessly.

This album features a compelling interplay between real piano and synthesized instruments, with each taking turns on melody and harmony. The result is a textured listening experience that balances organic and electronic tones.
