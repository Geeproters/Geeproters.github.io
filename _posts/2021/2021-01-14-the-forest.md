The Forest is a survival horror game developed by Endnight Games, where players find themselves stranded on a mysterious island after a plane crash. The game combines crafting, exploration, and survival elements, as players navigate a dangerous environment inhabited by cannibalistic mutants.

The game's soundtrack often enhances the eerie atmosphere of The Forest. But this track is just groovy:
