"Sunset Rollercoaster (Chinese: 落日飛車 Luòrì fēichē) is a 5-piece jazz-influenced synth-pop/rock band from Taipei, Taiwan consisting of Kuo-Hung Tseng (vocals, guitar), Hung-Li Chen (bass), Shao-Hsuan Wang (keyboard), Tsun-Lung Lo (drums), Hao-Ting Huang (saxophone), and former member Shih-Wei Huang (percussion)." The EP Jinji Kikko (2016) and the album Cassa Nova (2018) tell a love story from the perspectives of the girl (Jinji Kikko), and from the boy (Cassa Nova).

The last couple seconds of Cassa Nova use the same sample as the beginning of Jinji Kikko, tying the two together.
Their music has a soothing subtropical funk feel, apparently a result of inspiration from ’60s and ’70s garage and pre-punk music.
