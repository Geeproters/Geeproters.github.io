Sunset Rollercoaster is a five-piece band from Taipei blending jazz influences with synth-pop and rock. Their lineup includes Kuo-Hung Tseng (vocals, guitar), Hung-Li Chen (bass), Shao-Hsuan Wang (keyboard), Tsun-Lung Lo (drums), Hao-Ting Huang (saxophone), and formerly Shih-Wei Huang (percussion).

Their 2016 EP *Jinji Kikko* and 2018 album *Cassa Nova* form a narrative pair, telling a love story from the perspectives of a girl and a boy, respectively. The subtle connection between them is underscored by a shared sample that closes *Cassa Nova* and opens *Jinji Kikko*.

The band’s sound features soothing subtropical funk, drawing inspiration from ’60s and ’70s garage rock and pre-punk styles, giving their music a nostalgic yet fresh atmosphere.
