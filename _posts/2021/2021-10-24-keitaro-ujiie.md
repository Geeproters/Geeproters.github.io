Keitaro Ujiie, known as Snail’s House and Ujico*, is a Japanese electronic artist blending downtempo, bitpop, and chiptune with genres like wonky and picopop. Wonky features irregular, “off-kilter” beats and draws from hip hop, electro-funk, jazz fusion, and glitch, while picopop emerged in the early 2000s from Japan’s Shibuya-kei scene, emphasizing bright, “bleepy” electronic sounds. Together, these influences shape his distinctive style, sometimes described as digital fusion.

Though tracks like “Hot Milk” and “Pixel Galaxy” brought him wider recognition, his albums *空中都市* (Aeropolis, 2015) and *Dream Castle* (2016) offer immersive explorations of his soundscapes, combining melodic whimsy with complex rhythmic textures.
