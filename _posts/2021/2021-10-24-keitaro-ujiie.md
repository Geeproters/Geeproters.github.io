Keitaro Ujiie, also known as Snail's House or Ujico*, is a Japanese electronic musician. His music is classified as downtempo, bitpop, chiptune, wonky music (a subgenre of electronic music known primarily for its off-kilter or “unstable” beats, as well as its eclectic blend of genres including hip hop, electro-funk, chiptune, jazz fusion, glitch, and crunk), and picopop (an early 2000s offshoot of the Japanese Shibuya-kei movement when artists introduced more prominent "bleepy" electronic elements). His music also falls under the umbrella term of digital fusion. Though he's known for tracks like Hot Milk and Pixel Galaxy, here are a couple good full albums:
