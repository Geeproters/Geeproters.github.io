Little Simz’s 2021 album *Sometimes I Might Be Introvert* was the highest-rated album of the year on Rate Your Music, ranking #353 overall with a 3.95/5.0 score. It also holds the top spot for UK hip-hop and is the fifth highest-rated conscious hip-hop album, following legends like Mos Def, OutKast, A Tribe Called Quest, and Kendrick Lamar.

The album combines orchestral jazz-rap with neo-soul influences, creating a rich, textured sound that complements Little Simz’s introspective and sharp lyricism. The production balances lush instrumentation with tight beats, supporting her storytelling on themes of identity, society, and self-reflection.
