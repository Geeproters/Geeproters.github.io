Here's a track from the highest rated album of 2021 on Rate Your Music (#353 overall with 3.95/5.0); "Sometimes I Might Be Introvert" by Little Sims. On RYM, it's also currently the highest-rated UK hip-hop album, and the 5th highest rated Conscious hip-hop album, after albums by Mos Def, OutKast, A Tribe Called Quest, and Kendrick Lamar. Check out her NPR Tiny Desk to see her backing band, or listen to the rest of the hour-long album for more of the same. Some great orchestral jazz-rap and neo-soul.
