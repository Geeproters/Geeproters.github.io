Toe, stylized as toe, is a Japanese post-rock/math rock band from Tokyo. The group was founded in 2000. Here's Our Latest Number, a 4 song ep released 2018.

Here's my current favorite track of theirs, グッドバイ, or Goodbye. Originally released 2006.

While super technically impressive (the drumming especially) and utilizing classic math-rock techniques, toe also perfectly demonstrates the melancholic, bittersweet flavor that's become a staple of a lot of good math-rock and post-rock.


I should also mention that Goodbye is originally a 7 minute 30-second song, shortened for that video. There's also a 7-minute album version with a female vocalist. You can find both versions on the band's Spotify
