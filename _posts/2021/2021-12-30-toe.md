Toe, stylized as toe, is a Japanese post-rock/math rock band from Tokyo, founded in 2000. Their 2018 EP *Our Latest Number* features four tracks that blend intricate rhythms with emotive melodies.

One standout track is *グッドバイ* (Goodbye), originally released in 2006. It's technically impressive—especially the drumming—and showcases the melancholic, bittersweet tone that defines much of math and post-rock.

The video version of *Goodbye* is shortened from the original 7-minute 30-second song. A longer album version with a female vocalist is also available, both found on the band's Spotify.
