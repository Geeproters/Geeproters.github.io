Masakatsu Takagi is a Japanese composer known for his ambient, textured film scores, including *Wolf Children* and *The Boy and the Beast*. His music often blends acoustic instruments with atmospheric layers and soft, experimental vocalizations.

This track from *Mirai* (2018)—a film I haven’t seen yet—stood out in autoplay for its simple beauty. The piano is surrounded by ghostly harmonies and delicate vocal phrases, giving it a kind of dreamlike gravity.
