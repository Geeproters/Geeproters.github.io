Beautiful and haunting track from the anime movie "Mirai," which I haven't seen yet but got the soundtrack in my autoplay. The composer, Masakatsu Takagi, and wrote the soundtrack of Wolf Children which I mentioned a month ago. Aside from the various ambient textures, this track features some really interesting vocalizations backing the piano which lends to an interesting and pleasing effect.
