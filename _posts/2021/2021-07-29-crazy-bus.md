Crazy Bus is a 2004 unlicensed bus simulator for the Sega Genesis, originally created as a tech demo before an unauthorized third party released it on cartridge. Developed by Venezuelan Tom Scripts using the BasiEgaXorz IDE, it gained notoriety for its minimalist and quirky design, becoming a cult curiosity among retro gaming fans.

Though never officially published or endorsed by Sega, Crazy Busâ€™s odd charm and simple mechanics have made it a memorable part of gaming history, especially for enthusiasts of obscure or homebrew titles.
