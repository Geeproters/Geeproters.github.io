Baba Yetu is the well-known theme of Civilization IV, composed by Christopher Tin.

Though only Baba Yetu was used for the game, the album it belongs to - Calling All Dawns - won two Grammys at the 53rd Grammy Awards for Best Classical Crossover Album and Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist for the song "Baba Yetu". As such, Baba Yetu remains the only track (singular) from a video game to have won a Grammy.
