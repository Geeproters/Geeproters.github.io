Civilization IV is a popular turn-based strategy game where players build and expand an empire through different eras of history. Its theme song, Baba Yetu, composed by Christopher Tin, is well known for its uplifting and powerful choral arrangement.

Though only Baba Yetu was used in the game, the album it belongs to — Calling All Dawns — won two Grammys at the 53rd Grammy Awards for Best Classical Crossover Album and Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist for the song "Baba Yetu." Baba Yetu remains the only track from a video game to have won a Grammy.
