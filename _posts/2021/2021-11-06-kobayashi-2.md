Here are my top three tracks from the second season of *Kobayashi*, each by one of the main artists behind the soundtrack. Masumi Itō’s piece features really low bass notes. Kenji Kondo’s work tends to be string-heavy with world music influences. Kotringo’s track is my favorite and played during many key moments.
