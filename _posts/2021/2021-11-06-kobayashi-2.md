My favorite three tracks from the 2nd Season of Kobayashi, each by one of the three main artists who worked on the soundtrack:
 小さな幸せ
https://youtu.be/P-hSscINxTg (Masumi Itō (伊藤真澄)) really low bass notes.
 長い縁
https://youtu.be/xnAbwN640Xo (kenji kondo) Kondo's work was usually more string heavy and world music influenced.
 初めての気持ち
https://youtu.be/Y1kdlURsjRk (kotringo) my favorite of the three, also played during all of my favorite moments.
