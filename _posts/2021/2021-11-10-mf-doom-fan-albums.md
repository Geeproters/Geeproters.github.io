One of the ways MF DOOM’s legacy lives on is through a fan-made series called *The Lost Relics of Dumile*, compiled by Altered Hip Hop on YouTube. These six volumes gather “loosies and guest appearances from the Super Villain,” each with a distinct vibe reflecting different aspects of DOOM’s work.

Volume 1 feels like a solo album by DOOM himself.

Volume 2 resembles a double-disc producer album by Metal Fingers. All beats by MF.

Volume 3 takes on a darker, more sinister tone, similar to a Viktor Vaughn project.

Volume 4 channels King Geedorah’s style, with all beats by Metal Fingers.

Volume 5 collects remixes and live versions from DOOM’s catalog, including projects like *Madvillainy 2* and *GG DOOM*.

Volume 6 is more of a leftover mix, with DOOM hijacking various songs to make them his own.

Volume 1 has my favorite selection of tracks across the series.
