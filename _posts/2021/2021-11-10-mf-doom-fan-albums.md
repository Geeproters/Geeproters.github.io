I've talked about MF DOOM here before, but here's a series of 6 fan albums made out of "loosies and guest appearances from the Super Villain" made by Altered Hip Hop on YouTube. From the video's descriptions: 


Volume 1 is made to feel like solo album by DOOM,
 MF DOOM - The Lost Relics of Dumile Vol. I (2021) []FAN ALBUM[]

Volume 2 is made to feel like a double disc producer album by Metal Fingers. All beats by MF.
 MF DOOM - The Lost Relics of Dumile Vol. II (2021) []FAN ALBUM[]

Volume 3 is made to feel like solo album in a more sinister and dark way, almost like a VV project
 MF DOOM - The Lost Relics of Dumile Vol. III (2021) []FAN ALBUM[]

Volume 4 is made to feel like a King Geedorah album. All beats by metal fingers.
 MF DOOM - The Lost Relics of Dumile Vol. IV (2021) []FAN ALBUM[]

Volume 5 is a collection of remixes and live versions of DOOM songs. Go check out the full projects, Madvillany 2, GG DOOM etc.
 MF DOOM - The Lost Relics of Dumile Vol. V (2021) []FAN ALBUM[]

Volume 6 ended up as a leftover mix and it doesn't really have a particular sound or anything but it turned into an album of DOOM hijacking these songs for himself.

The first volume has my favorite selection of tracks from the six
