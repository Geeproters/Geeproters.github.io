Hella is a duo known for their intense, quirky, and technically complex approach to math rock. The primary members of the band are Spencer Seim on electric guitar and Zach Hill on drums. Zach Hill is best known now as the drummer and co-producer of the groups Death Grips.

Their 2002 album *Hold Your Horse Is* blends intricate guitar work with frenetic drumming. Here's the full album:

It's difficult or impossible to count out the time signatures for some of these songs. Apparently, much of the time they weren't actually counting them out, instead using musical cues to progress through the track.
