Witch house is a an influential electronic microgenre that surfaced in the late 2000s, blending elements of chopped and screwed hip hop, ambient drone, noise, industrial, and darkwave. Visually and thematically tied to occult imagery, it also draws sonic parallels to shoegaze and early trap production—often marked by slowed tempos, pitch-shifted vocals, and heavy reverb.

The genre sits in lineage with 1980s darkwave, itself a descendant of post-punk and new wave. But where darkwave leaned gothic, witch house veers into digital haze—more cyberpunk than cemetery.

This 2014 album by Sidewalks and Skeletons captures many of the genre’s signatures: synth-organ textures, sequenced drum machines, and layered atmospherics.

Makes use of modern samples (like police sirens) and synth-heavy soundscapes—especially on the timestamped track “Memory.”
