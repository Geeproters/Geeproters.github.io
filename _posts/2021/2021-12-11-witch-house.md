Witch house is an occult-themed electronic music microgenre and visual aesthetic that emerged in the late 2000s and early 2010s from House and Chillwave. It generally combines elements of chopped and screwed, drone, ethereal wave, industrial, noise, shoegaze, and trap. It's a bit like the second coming of Dark Wave, which emerged from the new wave and post-punk movement of the late 1970s. This album from Sidewalks and Skeletons is a good example of the genre. It makes use of a lot of synth organ, along with the classic drum machine and sequencer sounds. Certain tracks (like this timestamped one, Memory), make use of modern sounding samples like police sirens, reminiscent of a more cyberpunk aesthetic.
