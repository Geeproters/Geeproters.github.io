Scott Matthews is an English singer-songwriter whose 2006 debut album *Passing Stranger* blends folk-rock, blues, and indie influences with poetic lyricism and expressive guitar work. The album earned critical praise, particularly for its introspective tone and Matthews' distinctive vocal delivery—often compared to Jeff Buckley or Nick Drake.

A warm, introspective ballad marked by fingerpicked guitar and restrained vocals.

His breakout single—moody, blues-tinged, and quietly haunting.
