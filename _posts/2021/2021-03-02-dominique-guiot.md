Here's an excerpt on the album, by WRWTFWW Records:

Written, composed and played by Dominique Guiot with his Mellotron, Minimoog, clavinet, organ, and guitar, L’Univers de la Mer draws its inspiration from deep sea exploration, oceanic creatures, and underwater kingdoms. The 12-track album navigates organically through diverse mutations of the prog-rock and synth kind, from scenic meditation pieces ("Wind Surf Ballad"), to medieval electronica ("Une Ballade Pour Une Goélette"), spacey smooth jazz ("Les Deux Poissons"), funked out fantasy folk ("L’Univers De La Mer"), or even incredible Sega Mega-CD vibes ("La Danse Des Méduses") - altogether painting a fascinating world of eerie magic and subaquatic sensuality. It’s escapism at its best with subtle overtones of Schicke Führs Fröhling, Mike Oldfield, and Claude Perraudin.
