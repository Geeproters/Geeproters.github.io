Joe Hisaishi’s compositions have become inseparable from the emotional depth of Studio Ghibli’s films, shaping the soundscapes of childhood nostalgia for many. His ability to blend sweeping orchestration with intimate piano melodies gives his work a timeless quality, making his music as evocative as the stories they accompany.

It’s been 400 days exactly since I began this project, and in the spirit of reminiscing, here are a few Ghibli tracks that capture that feeling:
