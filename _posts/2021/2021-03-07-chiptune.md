Chiptune, also known as chip music or 8-bit music, is a style of synthesized electronic music traditionally created using sound chips from vintage arcade machines, computers, and video game consoles. Originating in Japan during the late 1970s to early 1980s, chiptune draws influences from video game music, techno, house music, synth-pop, and other forms of electronica.  

Here are a couple nice standalone tracks. Passepied was my first entry, from a few months ago:

And here's the 50th chiptune mix put together by Krelez on YouTube, released last month, which also includes post-chiptune and digital fusion:
