 Sweet Trip - Velocity : Design : Comfort.
https://youtu.be/fZlNt05dCX8 "chocolate matter" and "international" are my favorite tracks off the album. "dsco" is also good.


The album functions somewhat as a collage of various electronic and pop genres, so the sound and feelings vary greatly from track to track.
