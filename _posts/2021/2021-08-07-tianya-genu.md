"Tianya Genu" (天涯歌女), or "The Wandering Songstress," is one of the iconic theme songs from the 1937 Chinese film *Street Angel*. Composed by He Luting with lyrics by Tian Han, it was performed by Zhou Xuan in the film.

The song holds a special place in Chinese music history, often compared to the enduring fame of "As Time Goes By" from *Casablanca* in the West. It is celebrated as a classic Chinese love song that has resonated across generations.
