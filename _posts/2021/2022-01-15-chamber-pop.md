Chamber Pop is a style of Indie Pop also known originally as ork-pop (short for orchestral pop), which developed in the early to mid-1990s in part as a reaction to the rougher Grunge, Lo-Fi / Slacker Rock, and other Alternative Rock styles which were popular at the time. At its core is a particularly "retro" Pop sound based on the smooth and melodic songwriting of Lounge and other Easy Listening. Chamber pop artists still usually use(d) guitar, bass, and drums like other indie pop, but they would also often include accents of piano, strings, horns, winds, Rhodes, vibraphone, and other instruments less commonly found in contemporary Rock.

 If You're Feeling Sinister

Still Chamber Pop) Interesting tidbit: Other similar retro-pop movements would crop up in the 1990s as well and occasionally cross over with chamber pop, like the tongue-in-cheek lounge revival Cocktail Nation scene and the eclectic Japanese Shibuya-kei (talked about this before) music and fashion movement which featured many of the same influences.


Radiohead's A Moon Shaped Pool is a great example of this genre's sound, though not indie.

Amen Break, which I mentioned before. A very popularly sampled drum break in many genres of music. Breakcore and breakbeat for example.
