Chamber Pop, originally known as ork-pop (*orchestral pop*), developed in the early to mid-1990s as a reaction to the rougher aesthetics of Grunge, Lo-Fi / Slacker Rock, and other Alternative Rock styles popular at the time. Drawing influence from Lounge and Easy Listening, it favored smooth, melodic songwriting with intricate instrumentation. While still rooted in indie pop’s traditional guitar, bass, and drum setup, Chamber Pop frequently incorporated piano, strings, horns, winds, Rhodes, vibraphone, and other instruments uncommon in contemporary rock.

Other retro-pop movements in the 1990s occasionally crossed over with Chamber Pop, including the tongue-in-cheek lounge revival *Cocktail Nation* scene and Japan’s eclectic *Shibuya-kei* music and fashion movement.

Radiohead’s *A Moon Shaped Pool* exemplifies the genre’s sound, though it isn’t indie.
