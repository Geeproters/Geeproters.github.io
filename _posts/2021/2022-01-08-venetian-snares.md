Aaron Funk, known as Venetian Snares, is a Canadian electronic musician who helped shape the breakcore genre. His music blends industrial, glitchcore, hardcore jungle, noise, and 20th-century classical influences, creating an intense yet intricate sound.

Most of his work was released in the 2000s, with *Rossz Csillag Alatt Született* (2005) standing out as a landmark album. It combines frenetic, manic rhythms with atmospheric layers, often sampling Hungarian classical music to add depth and texture. The album balances chaos and melody, offering a unique listening experience that pushes the boundaries of electronic music.

This release is a key example of Venetian Snares’ innovative approach and lasting impact on experimental electronic styles.
