Neofolk, also known as Dark Folk or Apocalyptic Folk, is a form of experimental music that blends elements of folk and industrial music, emerging from punk rock circles in the 1980s. This genre can be purely acoustic or incorporate acoustic folk instrumentation alongside various other sounds. 

Ulvesang is a darkfolk/neofolk band from Nova Scotia, comprised of Alex Boyd and Ana Dujakovic. Their music draws inspiration from nature, animals, folklore, personal struggles with mental illness, and themes of melancholy.

Hereâ€™s their self-titled album from 2015:
