This guy makes mixes of Hirasawa's works. 
These two are mixes of two recordings of the same song:
 Susumu Hirasawa[GARDENER KING]+[GARDENER KING2]
https://youtu.be/LP18uJZuv2I
 Susumu Hirasawa [Venus] mix
https://youtu.be/1yv7OOj_qZo (gets good a minute in, my personal favorite) This one's a mix of two wholly different songs:
 Susumu Hirasawa[Forces]+[TAKE THE WHEEL]
https://youtu.be/BaWx3tICftU 
He's made a bunch but these ones stick out


Might be more enjoyable when you've heard the originals I guess. Oh yeah, and since the tracks are mixed L and R, it doesn't make sense to listen mono.
