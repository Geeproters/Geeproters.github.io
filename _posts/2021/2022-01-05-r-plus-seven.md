*R Plus Seven* is a 2013 electronic album by Oneohtrix Point Never that blends ambient, IDM, drone, glitch, and musique concrète elements. Musique concrète originally referred to early electronic music using tape manipulation and analog equipment. Today, it often involves natural sounds from field recordings, heavily processed or combined with pure electronic synthesis in abstract compositions usually lacking traditional melody and rhythm.

The album creates an immersive atmosphere through the contrast of acoustic pipe organ sounds and various electronic textures. It often feels floaty, visceral, and electrifying, pulling listeners into a richly layered sound world. *R Plus Seven* is a notable example of modern electroacoustic music pushing boundaries between the natural and synthetic.
