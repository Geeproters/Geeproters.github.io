R Plus Seven is an electronic album by Oneohtrix Point Never, released 2013. It could be classified as Ambient, IDM, Drone, and Glitch, with elements of Musique Concrète. Since I haven't mentioned it before, Musique Concrète describes very early electronic music that used tapes, tubes, transistors, and other electronic equipment. Nowadays, Musique Concrète uses natural sounds (from field recordings for instance), often heavily treated, and/or pure electronic sounds (analog / digital synthesis) in abstract compositions, mostly without melody and rhythm. Most electroacoustic/acousmatic often music falls into this category. Sometimes the term is used for field recordings and other soundscapes.

This album feels at times floaty, visceral, and electrifying. I find the atmosphere it creates to be really immersive and interesting, especially with the juxtaposition of the acoustic pipe organ and various electronic elements.
