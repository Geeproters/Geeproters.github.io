Changed my mind about doing more breakcore subgenres. Maybe later. I only listen to Classical Breakcore and Depressive Breakcore anyway. Since I already covered classical, Depressive Breakcore is a style of Breakcore that mixes the genre's hard, fast, and chopped up amen breaks with depressive Ambient interludes. The genre is heavily aesthetic-driven, featuring bleak and suicidal imagery and a dark artistic style which often draws from anime. 


Like in many other Breakcore substyles, Depressive Breakcore artists tend to emphasize extreme aesthetics and sounds over individual personalities, lending a sense of mystery and anonymity to the scene. 


Developed in the early to mid-2010s by goreshit and Waqs (particularly through his "i want to be dead" alias), the genre got a big boost in popularity in the early 2020s. This boost is often attributed to Sewerslvt, who pioneered a closely related style of Atmospheric Drum & Bass sometimes known as "Dreambreak" that draws influence from the atmospheres and intensity of Depressive Breakcore. In addition to Dreambreak, the genre is also sometimes associated with the HexD, Lolicore, Neo Y2K and Hardcore.

For more from those two big-names, listen to Sewerslvt's tracks "Newlove," or "Pretty Cvnt," or just their album "Draining Love Story". From Goreshit, "The Nature of Dying" also falls into the category of Classical Breakcore, This stuff is actually good
I'm kind of going in backward order in terms of complexity, but since I've already done hardcore breaks, breakcore, classicore, chipbreak, and depressive breakcore, I'll do something on a more pure version of breakbeat music next.
