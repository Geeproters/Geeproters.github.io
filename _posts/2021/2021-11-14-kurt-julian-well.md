Kurt Weill’s *Mack the Knife* has haunted stages and jazz clubs since 1928, blending dark theatrical flair with catchy melodies that made it a timeless standard.

Weill, a German-American composer, famously collaborated with Bertolt Brecht to create *The Threepenny Opera*. This song, originally a cynical ballad, evolved through countless covers—each adding a new layer to its legacy. Bobby Darin’s 1959 version topped charts in the US and UK, while jazz legends like Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald made it their own with charismatic performances.
