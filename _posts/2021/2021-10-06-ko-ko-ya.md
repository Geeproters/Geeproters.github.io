Choro, also known as "chorinho," is a traditional Brazilian instrumental music genre that emerged in Rio de Janeiro in the late 19th century. Despite its name meaning "cry" or "lament," choro is generally upbeat, virtuosic, and rhythmically complex. It is often considered Brazil’s first urban popular music style.

Choro blends European dance forms like polka, waltz, and schottische with Afro-Brazilian rhythms. Its defining features include intricate melodies, fast tempos, syncopation, and extensive improvisation. The instrumentation traditionally involves flute, guitar, cavaquinho (a small string instrument), and percussion, though modern ensembles often add violin, clarinet, and piano.

Choro’s influence extends beyond Brazil, impacting jazz and world music, and it remains a vital and evolving genre celebrated in festivals and jam sessions worldwide.
