ko-ko-ya is a Japanese Latin pop (choro) trio consisting of guitarist Shigeharu Sasago, violinist Saeko Kurokawa, and clarinetist Nyabo Ssebo. Here's one of my favorite tracks from them:

https://youtu.be/eh2IpScY650 "Choro, also popularly called chorinho, is an instrumental Brazilian popular music genre which originated in 19th century Rio de Janeiro. Despite its name (choro meaning "cry" or "lament"), the music often has a fast and happy rhythm. It is characterized by virtuosity, improvisation and subtle modulations, and is full of syncopation and counterpoint.”
