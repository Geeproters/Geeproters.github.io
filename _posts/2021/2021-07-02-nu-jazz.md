Nu jazz (aka Jazztronica) blends jazz influences with electronic music, incorporating jazz rhythms, textures, and live instrumentation into electronic compositions. Emerging in the 1990s, its roots lie in jazz fusion and electronic dance music, drawing from genres like IDM, downtempo, and breakbeat. While similar to acid jazz, nu jazz leans more on electronic elements than funk. Artists such as Amon Tobin and St Germain helped shape its sound, and it gained mainstream recognition through compilations like *Saint-Germain-des-Prés Café*. Contemporary artists have integrated the genre with genres like glitch hop and wonky.

Here's a great Nu Jazz album from 2021 by Caribbean-Belgian experimental jazz musician Nala Sinephro
