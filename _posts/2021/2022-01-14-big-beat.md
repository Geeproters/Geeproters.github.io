Big Beat emerged in Britain during the late 1990s, blending breakbeat rhythms with heavy basslines and a polished, pop-friendly structure. Despite its ties to Drum and Bass and Techno, it favored mid-tempo production—typically between 120 and 140 BPM—giving it a distinct groove that propelled acts like The Prodigy, The Chemical Brothers, and Fatboy Slim to mainstream success.

The *Tekken 3* PlayStation soundtrack also falls into Big Beat, alongside Alternative Dance, a genre that fuses Electronic elements with Alternative and Indie Rock through synthesizers and dance-driven rhythms.
