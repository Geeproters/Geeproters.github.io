Big beat is a style of Breakbeat, especially popular in Britain during the late 1990s, driven by edited breakbeats and prominent basslines. Although it shares many characteristics of related genres, such as Drum and Bass and Techno, big beat tends to be produced at relatively moderate tempos (usually between 120 to 140 beats per minute) and structured in a manner not too dissimilar to Pop music, with acts like The Prodigy, The Chemical Brothers and Fatboy Slim enjoying great mainstream success during the late 1990s. Here's Tekken 3:
