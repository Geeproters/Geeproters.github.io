Kikuo is a Japanese Vocaloid producer known for his distinctive use of unusual instrumental textures, harmonies, and samples. Really excellent production with meticulous attention to detail.

Here are some of my favorites from him:

[Kikuo - Hole-dwelling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I15sK7dNMOM)  

[Kikuo - Kara Kara Kara no Kara (Emptiness, Emptiness, Emptiness of Emptiness) Remastered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hL75gQUcu0A)  

[Kikuo - 赤ずきんの狼](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8k61RpfZEk)

**2024-10-29 update:** in late 2021 and into 2022 I uploaded several split stereo mixes of Vocaloid songs sung by isekai jouchou, a Japanese female "Virtual Singer" (In this case not a Vocaloid, but rather a real singer who uses a virtual persona), against the original Vocaloid audio.

Two of those included songs by Kikuo, which you can find here:
