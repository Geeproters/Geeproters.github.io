Cyrille Aimée is a French jazz vocalist known for her smoky, sultry tone that bridges French gypsy jazz and Dominican rhythmic influences. Her fluid phrasing and emotive delivery bring fresh life to classic and contemporary jazz material.

“Nuit Blanche” showcases her blend of styles with a vibrant, worldly feel. Her rendition of Duke Ellington’s “Solitude,” performed with the Rhythm Future Quartet—a gypsy jazz ensemble—captures the song’s melancholic elegance with a modern twist.

For context, here are two iconic earlier versions: Billie Holiday’s 1946 Decca recording, often considered definitive, and Ella Fitzgerald’s 1956 take on Verve, prized for its warmth and nuance.
