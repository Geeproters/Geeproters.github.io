Breakbeat is an umbrella term for EDM styles built around syncopated drum patterns—known as breakbeats—that grew out of early 1990s Breakbeat Hardcore. This UK rave-era genre mixes steady four-on-the-floor beats with hip-hop breakbeat samples, acid house bleeps, hoover sounds, and energetic piano riffs, creating a raw but danceable sound.

By the mid-1990s, Breakcore emerged from the hardcore, jungle, and drum and bass scenes. It pushes breakbeats into complex, chopped-up territory with frantic tempos and an often chaotic, noisy edge. While both styles share roots, Breakcore is generally less straightforward and harder to dance to, using samples from music, movies, and video games to build its intense textures.

Venetian Snares’s *Rossz Csillag Alatt Született* sparked a unique fusion: classical breakcore. This subgenre blends breakcore’s signature chaos with orchestral and classical music elements—sometimes in single tracks, other times across whole albums. Here are a few standout examples:

Classical breakcore remains my favorite breakcore subgenre.
