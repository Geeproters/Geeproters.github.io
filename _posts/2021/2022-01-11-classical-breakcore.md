The breakcore album I talked about a few days ago, Rossz Csillag Alatt Született by Venetian Snares, sparked a long-running trend in the breakcore community to mix breakcore and classical music together; classical breakcore. Some were one-off tracks, others were whole albums and EPs, and some artists made continued attempts off their whole discography. Here are a few examples:
 The Nature of Dying

 Unpleasant Sonata

Classical breakcore is my preferred breakcore subgenre. I'll go over a few others in the following days.


Side note, from the last one, "Unpleasant Sonata" by Igorrr samples Les cyclopes by 18th century composer Jean-Philippe Rameau. Here are two versions of the composition:
 19. J.P.Rameau - Les Cyclopes (Rondeau) - Pièces de Clavecin (Scott Ross)

There's much to be said and compared between the harpsichord and the piano. I personally find both to be emotive, and whichever I prefer depends on my mood. The breakcore version is still the best though lol

I realize now that despite this being the 9th time I've mentioned it, I've never really described what breakcore is. 


Before moving on, I should note that Breakbeat describes an umbrella of affiliated EDM styles broadly characterized by prominent syncopated drum patterns (breakbeats) that emerged from Breakbeat Hardcore's initial influence, not including styles directly related to Drum and Bass and Jungle. Breakbeat hardcore (also referred to as hardcore rave or oldskool hardcore) is a music genre of the very early 1990s that spawned from the UK rave scene. It combines four-on-the-floor rhythms with breakbeats usually sampled from hip hop. In addition to the inclusion of breakbeats, the genre also features shuffled drum machine patterns, hoover and other noises originating from new beat, acid house squelches and bleeps, and often upbeat house piano riffs and vocals. 


Comparatively, "Breakcore" is a style and microgenre of electronic dance music that emerged from jungle, hardcore, and drum and bass in the mid-to-late 1990s. It is characterized by very complex and intricate breakbeats and a wide palette of sampling sources played at high tempos. To oversimplify, while both Breakcore and Hardcore Breakbeats are similar, a difference can be heard with Breakcore sounding more complex, and often less danceable than Hardcore Breakbeat. More specifically, Breakcore as a genre can be described as a form of Hardcore [EDM], characterized by the use of complex chopped breakbeats. Pure Breakcore tracks are typically noisy and chaotic, and often feature samples from a variety of media including music, movies, and video games.


Leaning further into that "feature samples from a variety of media including music, movies, and video games" part:
