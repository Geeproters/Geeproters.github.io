title: "341: Steven Universe – Motifs and Musical Fusions"

Something *Steven Universe* does brilliantly is build musical motifs for its characters using genre, instrumentation, harmony, and fusion—both in narrative and sound. This musical language not only reinforces character identity, but evolves with them through the show’s complex fusion system.

A fan breakdown from several years ago outlines these motifs well, even if some info is missing:  
[I've compiled a list of each characters motif instruments. : r/stevenuniverse](https://www.reddit.com/r/stevenuniverse/comments/6afn3s/ive_compiled_a_list_of_each_characters_motif/)

Examples:

[Pearl's Theme](https://youtu.be/fdyviD4yong) – classical (sometimes swing) piano  
[Amethyst's Theme](https://youtu.be/pk_aLZ2cwGA) – drum kit + bass in a wild, hip-hop style  
[Opal's Theme](https://youtu.be/aYXb_BaP_ls) – a fusion of both piano and drums  

Garnet, a fusion herself, combines:  
[Future Vision (Garnet's Theme)](https://youtu.be/eNpHzq5bfYI) – waveform synths + pads  
[Sardonyx](https://youtu.be/-Ya0JgTW18s) – Garnet x Pearl  
[Sugilite](https://youtu.be/AblGGgqOUi8) – Garnet x Amethyst  

And Alexandrite, a fusion of *all three*, features each instrument subtly altered—Pearl’s piano gains swing, Sapphire’s synths become distorted, and Amethyst’s bass supports rather than leads:

Even antagonists have harmonic motifs—like the Diamonds, each voiced through chords on a harmonette fed through synth:

[Diamond Authority Theme Tones](https://youtu.be/NtDSwFTjcfk)  
White – F♯maj7  
Yellow – Bmaj7  
Blue – Emaj7  
Pink – Amaj7  

These fall along the flat side of the circle of fifths, often described as “darker” sounding—fitting the show's emotional tone and character arcs.
