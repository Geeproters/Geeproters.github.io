Something Steven Universe does great is use recurring motifs to represent its characters, particularly in the form of instruments, harmonies, genre, and fusions between each of those. This post lists the instrumental motifs belonging to most of the major characters. There's some info missing since its from 6 years ago, but it provides good examples of each.
I've compiled a list of each characters motif instruments. : r/stevenuniverse 
The show uses these instrumental motifs with its fusion system, where characters can combine. For example, Pearl's theme represented by classical (sometimes swing) piano:

 Steven Universe S2 Official Soundtrack | Amethyst's Theme | Cartoon Network

And Opal's, the fusion between the previous two characters, and thus also a fusion of their respective styles and instruments:

Garnet is a fusion of Ruby (simple waveform in between a square and a saw wave) and Sapphire (gentle synth pad):

Here's her theme mixed with Pearl's.

with Amethyst's.

Finally, here's the theme of Alexandrite, a fusion of genres and instruments of all four of those previously mentioned. It's only 21 seconds, but you can hear each of the piano, drums, and synth as mentioned before. Going even further, you'll hear that the normally proper/rigid piano of Pearl becomes more swing influenced, Sapphire's normally soft synth becomes harsh, and Amethyst's bass backs the rest, instead of playing a more front-facing role.

These motifs go a long way to make characters and scenes meaningful or memorable, and above that, the fusion of instruments is great fun to listen to. Aside from instruments and genres, in the harmony, for example, each of the Diamonds (4 of the primary antagonists of the series) are represented by a singular instrument (strings and harmonette fed through a synth effect), but through different chords as follows:

Aside from that, these chords go through the flat side of the circle of fifths, often described by musicians as "dark sounding" compared to the sharp side which is "bright." white - F# maj 7 yellow - B maj 7 blue - E maj 7 pink - A maj 7
