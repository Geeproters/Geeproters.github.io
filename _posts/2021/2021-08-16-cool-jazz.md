title: "242: Chet Baker and Cool Jazz"

Cool Jazz emerged in the late 1940s as a mellower, more measured response to the complexity and fire of bebop. Often marked by smooth phrasing, restrained emotion, and a softer timbre, it gave space and silence a seat in the rhythm section.

Chet Baker, dubbed the "prince of cool," was central to the style. With his fragile, almost whisper-like vocal delivery and lyrical trumpet playing, Baker brought a melancholic intimacy to jazz standards. His collaborations, particularly his pianoless quartet with baritone saxophonist Gerry Mulligan, defined the sound of West Coast cool.
