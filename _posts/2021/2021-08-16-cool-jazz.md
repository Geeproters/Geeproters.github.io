Cool Jazz is a style of modern jazz music that arose in the United States after WWII (late 40s), characterized by relaxed tempos and a lighter tone compared to the fast and complex bebop (early 40s) style Chet Baker was an American jazz trumpeter and vocalist, one of the most influential musicians ever, jazz or otherwise. He is known for making major innovations within the cool jazz subgenre, which lead to him being nicknamed the "prince of cool". Here are some popular Jazz standards played and sung by Baker in that subdued and melancholic style:
