Frederic Anthony Rzewski was an American composer and pianist who is considered to be one of the most important American composer-pianists of his time. He unfortunately passed away on June 26, 2021, 5 months ago. He was known for his neo-classical composing style and technique which often required elements of spontaneous improvisation. "The People United is a set of 36 variations on the Chilean song "¡El pueblo unido jamás será vencido!" by Sergio Ortega and Quilapayún. The 36 variations, following the 36 bars of the tune, are in six groups of six... The pianist, in addition to needing a virtuoso technique, is required to whistle, slam the piano lid, and catch the after-vibrations of a loud attack as harmonics: all of these are "extended" techniques in 20th-century piano writing. Much of the work uses the language of 19th-century romanticism, but mixes this language with pandiatonic tonality, modal writing, and even serial techniques... As in the Goldberg Variations by Johann Sebastian Bach, the final variation is a direct restatement of the original theme, intended to be heard with new significance after the long journey through the variations."
