Frederic Rzewski (1938–2021) was a groundbreaking American composer-pianist known for blending 20th-century techniques with classical forms and political themes. His work often merged rigorous structure with moments of improvisation and extended techniques.

*The People United Will Never Be Defeated!* (1975) is a monumental set of 36 variations on a Chilean protest song, requiring the pianist to whistle, tap the piano lid, and perform with intense virtuosity. Like Bach’s *Goldberg Variations*, the final restatement of the theme reframes everything that came before.
