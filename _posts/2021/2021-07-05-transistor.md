200 entries in. I'm a little behind, but I’ll try to catch up soon. 

Doing these certainly has helped me find lots of interesting songs and soundtracks. I feel I may have focused too much on anime soundtrack music, and I've also posted a lot from Kevin Penkin and Susumu Hirasawa. Maybe I'll try to diversify more going forward.

This time, some of my favorites from the *Transistor* soundtrack:

*Transistor* is an action RPG developed by Supergiant Games. It stands out with its unique setting, premise, mechanics, and soundtrack. The game’s music blends elements of post-rock and industrial music, though it also explores other genres. *Transistor* was well-received, continuing Supergiant’s successful run of critically acclaimed games.

Here's a nice dissection of one aspect of the music theory behind the game's soundtrack

As mentioned in the comments, compared to Bastion's, and Hades' soundtracks which are more like Trip Hop Folktronica and Alt/Prog Metal, Transistor's OST has an old-world electronic post-rock feel and composition style.
