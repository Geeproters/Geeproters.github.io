*Severant* is a progressive electronic album by Kuedo that blends elements of UK bass, IDM, and footwork. Its sound is synth-driven and spacious, often described as dreamlike and futuristic.

Kuedo called it "an album of dreamlike music, loaded with his own preoccupations with futurism and escapism."
