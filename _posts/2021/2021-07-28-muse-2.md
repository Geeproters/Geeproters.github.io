Simulation Theory, released in 2019, marked a fresh direction for Muse with a strong '80s synth-pop and retro-futuristic vibe. The album mixes rock with electronic and synth elements, showcasing the band's ability to evolve while maintaining their signature intensity.

Muse is known for pushing boundaries in both sound and stage production, and Simulation Theory reflects their interest in nostalgia and sci-fi themes. The albumâ€™s title and visuals play on ideas of simulated realities and digital culture, making it a conceptually rich experience.
