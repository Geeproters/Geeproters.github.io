Mort Garson was a Canadian-born composer, arranger, and songwriter, recognized as a pioneer of electronic music. His innovative work remains highly influential, especially in genres like chiptune, dungeon synth, and other video game-inspired music. Here are a couple of his notable works:

[Deja Vu - Mort Garson (Track from The Unexplained, 1975)](https://youtu.be/AumYP6Np1eI)  
(The full album isn't available as one video, so here's my favorite track from *The Unexplained*, released under the name Ataraxia.)

[(Mother Earth's) Plantasia - Mort Garson (1976) Full Album](https://youtu.be/l0vrsO3_HpU?t=795)  
*Plantasia* was composed specifically for plants to listen to.

At a timestamp on *Plantasia*, there is a melody that seems to have inspired Koji Kondo’s composition of Princess Zelda's theme for *The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess*. This motif has become one of Zelda’s most recognizable themes.
