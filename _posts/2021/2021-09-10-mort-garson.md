Mort Garson was a composer, arranger, songwriter, and Canadian-born pioneer of electronic music. His work remains immensely influential to electronic music production today, especially in genres like chiptune and dungeon synth, and other video game-esque music. Here are a couple of his popular works:
 Deja Vu

 (Mother Earth's) Plantasia -- Mort Garson (1976) Full Album
https://youtu.be/l0vrsO3_HpU?t=795 ((Mother Earth's) Plantasia, from 1976) The music on Plantasia was apparently composed specifically for plants to listen to.


Timestamped on Plantasia is a melody, which I think Koji Kondo used in the composition of Princess Zelda's theme 
(Princess Zelda's Theme - The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess), 
and which later became one of Zelda's most recognizable motifs.
