Chipbreak is a subgenre of chiptune that fuses the sound with breakcore drum patterns. It was established in the mid-2000s by artists like Sabrepulse, Saskrotch, and Kkrusty. It commonly features nostalgic melodies reminiscent of retro video game tracks, samples or remixes of music from video games, and crossovers with other genres (jungle, hardcore, etc.). While most of its key artists have moved on from the sound, it still has a small presence on sites like Bandcamp. (It's actually pretty hard to find any chipbreak on Spotify) This was big like 20-9 years ago, now its pretty much completely dead.
