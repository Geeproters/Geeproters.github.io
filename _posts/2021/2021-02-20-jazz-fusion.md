Jazz fusion emerged in the late 1960s, blending jazz with elements from rock, funk, R&B, and folk music, and is characterized by the use of electric instruments like guitars and keyboards. While rooted in jazz's improvisational tradition, fusion stands out for its simpler harmonies and reliance on repeated, composed phrases in the rhythm section (vamping), as opposed to the more improvisational "comping" in traditional jazz. This style drew from modal jazz and post-bop, with Miles Davis' In a Silent Way and Bitches Brew being pivotal early examples that helped define the genre. Fusion became commercially successful, with many musicians from Davis' recordings going on to lead influential fusion bands. Throughout the 1970s, fusion diversified into substyles like "free fusion" and synthesizer-driven approaches, influencing jazz-funk and jazz-rock. In the 1980s, fusion's influence blended with pop and R&B, contributing to the development of smooth jazz, while also impacting chamber jazz.

I've been listening to some Japanese Jazz fusion lately. Here’s some of that:
