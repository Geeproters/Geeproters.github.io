Something like the 12th video by Susumu Hirasawa I've put on here now. Here's the album гипноза (Gipnoza). Hirasawa release it under the name Kaku P-Model, a solo continuation of the band P-Model which he previously led. It was the second of three albums he's released under the name Kaku P-Model so far.
