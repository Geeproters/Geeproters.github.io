Zenzile Miriam Makeba (1932–2008), known as “Mama Africa,” was a South African singer, activist, and one of the earliest global ambassadors of African music. She helped popularize Afropop and world music in the West, blending Xhosa rhythms, jazz, and political fire.

Her life was deeply shaped by apartheid. After the Sharpeville massacre in 1960, Makeba’s South African passport was revoked—barring her from returning home for over 30 years. She lived in exile, raising awareness abroad while unable to attend her own mother’s funeral. She survived cancer, early abuse, and constant political turbulence—all while becoming one of the most recognizable African voices of the 20th century.

Two of her best-known songs (both in Xhosa, a language famous for its click consonants):

Makeba didn’t just sing about freedom—she lived its costs, and still made the world dance.
