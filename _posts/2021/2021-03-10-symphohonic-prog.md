Symphonic Prog is the most prominent sub-genre of classic Progressive Rock, characterized by its incorporation of classical, often orchestral, elements. Bands in this genre frequently use compositional techniques that feature extended song forms and complex structures, diverging from standard popular music formats. This often includes lush keyboards and layered arrangements that mimic orchestral textures.

Some of the most iconic Symphonic Prog bands are Yes, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Camel, and early Genesis. The Italian prog scene also contributed significantly to this style, with groups like Premiata Forneria Marconi, Banco del Mutuo Soccorso, and Le Orme.

Neo-Prog shares similarities with Symphonic Prog but generally leans toward simpler structures and more conventional song formats.

Released in 1974, *Relayer* is one of Yesâ€™s most ambitious albums, known for its complex structures and fusion of jazz and rock influences. This album was the first Yes album to feature Patrick Moraz on keyboards, giving it a distinctive sound.
