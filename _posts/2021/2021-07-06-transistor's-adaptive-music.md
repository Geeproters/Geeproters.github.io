title: "201: Transistor's Adaptive Music"

As with *Pyre* (another of Supergiant's games), *Transistor* makes interesting use of adaptive music. In the game, by holding the Hum button while stationary, your character hums along with the background music. Additionally, activating Turn(), which freezes movement and allows the player to plan attacks, triggers a different version of the track (muffled with humming).  

Hereâ€™s an example:
