*Two Dots* is a mobile puzzle game by Playdots, Inc., notable not just for its clean design and gameplay but also for its relaxing and atmospheric soundtrack. The music—composed by Upright T-Rex Music—blends gentle melodies with rich instrumentation, lending the game a soothing, almost meditative quality.

The official YouTube playlist includes Volumes 1–6 of the soundtrack, though Volumes 7 and 8 are not yet included.

Warm textures and ambient motifs make this a pleasant background listen.
