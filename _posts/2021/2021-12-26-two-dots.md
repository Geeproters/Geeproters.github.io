Two Dots is a puzzle video game for iOS and Android, developed and published by American indie studio Playdots, Inc. Linked is the topic channel's official playlist for the first 6 OST volumes of the game, missing volumes 7 and 8. The soundtrack Upright T-Rex Music composed for the game is relaxing and easy to listen to, but interesting in its instrumentation and production.
