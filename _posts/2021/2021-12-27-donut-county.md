Here are a couple of tracks composed by Daniel Koestner for Donut County, another mobile game. His music often combines glitch-based audio with non-electric instrumentation, usually upbeat and relaxing tracks. Doing this adds a layer of rhythm and complexity to the music, and is pretty satisfying to listen to.
