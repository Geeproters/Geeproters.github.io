Daniel Koestner composed the soundtrack for *Donut County*, a physics-based indie puzzle game. His work blends acoustic instrumentation with glitchy, digital textures—creating tracks that are rhythmically intricate yet laid-back. The result is a sound that feels both handcrafted and playfully synthetic.

Indie pop/acoustic type beat.
