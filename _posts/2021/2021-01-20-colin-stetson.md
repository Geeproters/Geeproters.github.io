Colin Stetson is a Canadian-American experimental saxophonist, multireedist, composer, and sound engineer. His work exemplifies exceptional technical skill and also physical endurance.

Stetson is known for his innovative approach, drawing inspiration from a variety of sources, including the didgeridoo techniques of Indigenous Australian cultures. His music is often trance-like. He combines multiple advanced techniques to create a unique sound.

He often employs these three separate techniques simultaneously: 

1. Circular breathing, allowing for an unbroken airflow.
2. What I believe is conscious, rhythmic key tapping to introduce percussive elements.
3. Vocalization or growling into the instrument, for harmony or melody.

Here are two tracks that showcase his ability to simultaneously perform complex sequences while producing distinct melodies:
