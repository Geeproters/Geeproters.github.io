Yoko Kanno’s soundtrack for *Kids on the Slope* pays tribute to classic jazz with careful period detail and expressive arrangements. The anime, directed by Shinichirō Watanabe, centers around high school students bonding over jazz in 1960s Japan—a rare setting for the genre in animation.

This version of George Shearing’s 1952 jazz standard “Lullaby of Birdland,” famously covered by Ella Fitzgerald, features vocals by Aoi Teshima and a smooth, melodic phrasing that fits the show’s tone.

Lush and lyrical.
