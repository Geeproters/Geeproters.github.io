PSYQUI is a Japanese producer blending hyper-clean EDM production with pop sensibilities. Best known for high-energy tracks that land somewhere between club anthems and anime openings, his music often leans into the "kawaii future bass" aesthetic.

He’s also remarkably versatile—experimenting with psytrance, glitch, breakbeat, drum and bass, and more.
