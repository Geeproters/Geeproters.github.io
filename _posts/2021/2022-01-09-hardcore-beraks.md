Hardcore breaks is a revival of breakbeat hardcore (genre of the very early 1990s that spawned from the UK rave scene. It combines four-on-the-floor rhythms with breakbeats usually sampled from hip hop) which emerged in the 2000s, bringing in modern influences and production techniques. This style of EDM is one of many under the category of "House Music." These albums could also be called Scouse house (similar in ways to "happy hardcore"), as they feature an upbeat, energetic, and bouncy sound described as being bouncy. Like a lot of hardcore breaks, these albums have a somewhat internet and videogame inspired aesthetic and sound.


Here's a hardcore breaks album released on new Year's day, Digimaiden by Nanoray.

Miku, Miku, you can call me Miku Blue hair, blue tie, hiding in your wi-fi Open secrets, anyone can find me Hear your music running through my mind I'm thinking Miku, Miku (hoo-hee-hoo) I'm thinking Miku, Miku (hoo-hee-hoo) I'm thinking Miku, Miku (hoo-hee-hoo) I'm thinking Miku, Miku (hoo-hee-hoo) I'm on top of the world because of you All I wanted to do is follow you I'll keep singing along to all of you I'll keep singing along I'm thinking Miku, Miku (hoo-hee-hoo) I'm thinking Miku, Miku (hoo-hee-hoo) I'm thinking Miku, Miku (hoo-hee-hoo) I'm thinking Miku, Miku (hoo-hee-hoo) Miku, Miku, what's it like to be you? 20, 20, looking in the rear view Play me, break me, make me feel like Superman You can do anything you want I'm on top of the world because of you All I wanted to do is follow you I'll keep singing along to all of you I'll keep singing along I'm on top of the world because of you I do nothing that they could never do I'll keep playing along with all of you I'll keep playing along I'm thinking Miku, Miku (hoo-hee-hoo) I'm thinking Miku, Miku (hoo-hee-hoo) I'm thinking Miku, Miku (hoo-hee-hoo) I'm thinking Miku, Miku (hoo-hee-hoo) Where we were walking together? I will see you in the end I'll take you where you've never been, then bring you back again Listen to me with your eyes, I'm watching you from in the sky If you forget I'll fade away, I'm asking you to let me stay So bathe me in your magic light, and keep it on in darkest night I need you here to keep me strong, to live my life and sing along I'm lying with you wide awake, like your expensive poison snake You found me here inside a dream, walk through the fire straight to me
