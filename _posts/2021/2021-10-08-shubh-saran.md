Shubh Saran is a New York-based guitarist and composer who has performed globally with his band including in the United States, India, Canada, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Mexico. His compositions are an interesting fusion of sounds from modern jazz, neo-soul, and rock with classical and contemporary Indian music. This track in particular sounds like a mix between math rock and modal jazz
