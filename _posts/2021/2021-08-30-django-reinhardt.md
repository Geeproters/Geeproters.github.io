"Jean Reinhardt, known by his Romani nickname Django, was a Belgian-born Romani-French jazz guitarist and composer. He has been hailed as one of the first major jazz talents to emerge in Europe, and as one of its most significant exponents." Reinhardt's quintet was among the first to feature a guitar as the lead instrument. He, along with French-Italian jazz violinist St√©phane Grappelli, invented the genre of "Gypsy jazz" (also known as gypsy swing, jazz manouche, or hot club-style jazz). Here's a newer recording of one of maybe the most well-known "Gypsy jazz" compositions, written by Reinhardt in 1937, and played again by Rhythm Future Quartet in 2013.
