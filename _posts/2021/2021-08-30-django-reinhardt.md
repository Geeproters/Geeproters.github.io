Jean Reinhardt, known by his Romani nickname Django, was a Belgian-born Romani-French jazz guitarist and composer. He is widely regarded as one of the first major jazz talents to emerge in Europe and one of its most influential figures. Reinhardt's quintet was among the first to feature the guitar as the lead instrument. 

Together with French-Italian jazz violinist St√©phane Grappelli, he pioneered the genre known as "Gypsy jazz" (also called gypsy swing, jazz manouche, or hot club-style jazz). This style blends swing jazz with Romani musical traditions, marked by fast tempos, virtuosic guitar playing, and energetic rhythms.

Here's a modern recording of one of Django Reinhardt's most famous compositions, "Minor Swing," performed by the Rhythm Future Quartet in 2013:
