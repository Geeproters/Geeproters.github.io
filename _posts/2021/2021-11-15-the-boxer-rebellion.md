The Boxer Rebellion (1899–1901) was a violent anti-foreign and anti-Christian uprising in late Qing dynasty China, led by a martial arts militia called the Boxers (Yìhéquán). It sparked international conflict when the Eight-Nation Alliance—comprising troops from America, Europe, Japan, and Russia—intervened to protect foreign legations and civilians.

The uprising ended with a crushing defeat for the Boxers and harsh reparations imposed on China, including a massive indemnity paid over decades. This historical clash inspired the film *55 Days at Peking*, which features a theme song recorded in multiple languages, reflecting the multinational nature of the conflict.

Here’s a compilation of five versions of “55 Days at Peking,” sung in English, German, Japanese, Italian, and Spanish:

The first version is by The Brothers Four, an American folk group formed in 1957. They’re also known for their cover of “Goodnight Irene,” a classic American folk tune:
