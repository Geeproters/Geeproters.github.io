"The Boxer Rebellion, the Boxer Uprising or the Yihetuan Movement, was an anti-foreign, anti-Christian and anti-imperialist uprising which was staged in China between 1899 and 1901, towards the end of the Qing dynasty, by the Militia United in Righteousness (Yìhéquán), known as the Boxers in English because many of its members had practised Chinese martial arts, which at the time were referred to as Chinese Boxing. An Eight Nation Alliance of American, Austro-Hungarian, British, French, German, Italian, Japanese and Russian troops moved into China to lift the siege and rescue stranded civilians. The Empress Dowager Cixi, who had initially been hesitant, now supported the Boxers and on 21 June issued an Imperial Decree declaring war on the invading powers. Chinese officialdom was split between those supporting the Boxers and those favouring conciliation, led by Prince Qing. The Eight-Nation Alliance, after being initially turned back by the Imperial Chinese military and Boxer militia brought 20,000 armed troops to China, defeated the Imperial Army in Tianjin, and arrived in Beijing on 14 August, relieving the siege of the Legations. Plunder of the capital and the surrounding countryside ensued, along with summary execution of those suspected of being Boxers in retribution. The Boxer Protocol of 7 September 1901 provided for the execution of government officials who had supported the Boxers, provisions for foreign troops to be stationed in Beijing, and 450 million taels of silver—approximately $10 billion at 2018 silver prices and more than the government's annual tax revenue—to be paid as indemnity over the course of the next 39 years to the eight nations involved. Here's a compilation of 5 versions of the song "55 Days at Peking," form the film of the same name. The versions are the English, German, Japanese, Italian, and Spanish variations of the song.

That first version of that previous song was sung by The Brothers Four, an American folk singing group, founded in 1957. Here're a couple covers of a famous American folk tune, Goodnight Irene, by them.
