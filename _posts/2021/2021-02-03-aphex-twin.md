Recently, I've been diving into some Aphex Twin. I think I might prefer his upbeat techno electronica over his more ambient works. One standout album is Surfing on Sine Waves, released in 1993. 

Hereâ€™s the full album:  
[Aphex Twin - Surfing on Sine Waves 2 [FULL ALBUM]](https://youtu.be/htt1fNiKYcQ)  

Two of my favorite tracks from this album include:  

[Aphex Twin - 35 Japan (1080p HD/HQ)](https://youtu.be/S7c_OYURKss) - This track has a distinctly industrial feel, complemented by great drums.  

[Afx (Aphex Twin) - 6 Plinky Plonk[orig]](https://youtu.be/hm3GQSZGqOk) - This one features interesting samples and synth lines.
