World's End Girlfriend is the alias of Katsuhiko Maeda, a composer and producer from the Gotō Islands in Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan. Active since the late 1990s, Maeda is known for fusing post-rock, electronica, ambient, and classical music into densely layered compositions that often defy genre boundaries.

His work frequently integrates techniques from glitch, noise, breakcore, and sound collage—resulting in soundscapes that contrast melodic elements with bursts of distortion or rhythmic fragmentation. Jazz and Japanese rock influences also surface throughout his discography, reflecting a deliberately eclectic style. Many of his albums, including *Last Waltz* and *Seven Idiots*, function as conceptual suites, structured more like film scores than traditional records.

Maeda's compositions feel like controlled chaos—sprawling yet intricately composed, with a structural complexity reminiscent of avant-garde cinema.

A relatively subdued piece with rich harmonic layering and ambient textures.
