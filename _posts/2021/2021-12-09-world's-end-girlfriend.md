Katsuhiko Maeda, better known by his stage name World's End Girlfriend, is a Japanese musician from Got≈ç Islands, Nagasaki Prefecture. His music is primarily a mix of Post-rock, Electronica, Ambient music, Classical music, and Dance/Electronic. An experimental sound often combining abrasive sounds with pleasant ones. There are influences from Jazz, Noise, Glitch, and Breakcore/Sound Collage to be heard in a lot of his music. Here are a few of his tracks I like:
 World's End Girlfriend - 100 Years of Choke [HQ]
https://youtu.be/KYBulfbBstc (more relaxed than the following tracks, lots of interesting textures and harmonies)
 world's end girlfriend / Girl / from "LAST WALTZ"
https://youtu.be/5E-t0UvrNT0 (can really hear the mix of pleasant and abrasive noise)
 world's end girlfriend / MEGURI / MUSIC VIDEO
https://youtu.be/YUpB_COsAdA (more obvious classical and post-rock influences)
 world's end girlfriend - Les Enfants du Paradis (MUSIC VIDEO) from"SEVEN IDIOTS"
https://youtu.be/PfG_G2O2q40 (more obvious Japanese rock influences) World's End Girlfriend's music really does sound like the end of the world. The type you just sit back and relax to.
