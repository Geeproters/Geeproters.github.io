Machine Girl is an American electronic music project created in 2013 by Matt Stephenson in Long Island, New York. In 2018, the project became a duo, with Stephenson recruiting percussionist Sean Kelly to play live drums. Their music mixes influences from 
Hardcore Breaks, Footwork, and UK Bass. Mood-wise, their tracks cycle between heavier and lighter punk-influenced electronic sounds, but are always percussive and usually high-tempo. The textural quality of the sound contributes to a trance-like effect, drawing listeners in.

UK bass is a style of electronic dance music that evolved from the dubstep scene in the late 2000s. Known for its deep, atmospheric sound and emphasis on bass, it incorporates eclectic rhythms and influences from genres like UK funky, juke, footwork, and techno. While it shares dubstep’s darker, minimalist vibe, UK bass is more experimental with tempo and rhythm, often breaking from dubstep’s signature 140 BPM and halftime beats. Distinct labels like Night Slugs and Hessle Audio each developed unique strains of UK bass, blending elements from regional and genre-specific influences, leading to a varied genre landscape by the 2010s. UK bass helped inspire further EDM genres such as deconstructed club, weightless grime, and hard drum, impacting alternative R&B and certain pop styles along the way.
