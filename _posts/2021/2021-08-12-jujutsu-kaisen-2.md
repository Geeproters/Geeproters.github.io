The JJK OST is great all-around. Relatively unusual for anime soundtracks - there's lots of hip-hop and rap from non-Japanese artists, with various other influences like metal, classical, and electronica. Manages to perfectly establish both the show's spookier moments of atmosphere, as well as when it gets energetic or aggressive. Here are my top 3 tracks:
 The Scariest

 Upbringing

 Occult Phenomenon Research Club
https://youtu.be/9PAZHCK7178 (my favorite of the bunch)
