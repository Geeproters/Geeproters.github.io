The *Jujutsu Kaisen* soundtrack stands out from typical anime scoring. It incorporates hip-hop, rap (often by non-Japanese artists), metal, classical, and electronica—creating a textured, genre-fluid soundscape. It nails the show’s eerie, suspenseful vibe just as well as its most explosive fight scenes.

Here are three standout tracks that show the OST’s range:
