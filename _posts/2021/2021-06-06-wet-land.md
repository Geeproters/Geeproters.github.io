Since I'm on the topic of Ambient music, here’s maybe my favorite ambient album, *Wet Land* (1993) by Hiroshi Yoshimura. I talked about ambient pioneer Hiroshi Yoshimura beifly on rec 22. His music lies mostly in the minimalist genre of *kankyō ongaku*, or environment music - soft electronic melodies infused with the sounds of nature.

A "healing" new age album that I come back to often. The album's sound is not too much, not too little, squarely between active & passive listening.
