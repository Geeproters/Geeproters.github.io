*The World’s Hardest Game* is a minimalist flash game known for its challenging gameplay and addictive design. Its soundtrack is simple but effective—looped electronic chiptune melodies that capture the tension and nostalgia of early 2000s browser games.

This official soundtrack highlights how limited sonic palettes can still create a memorable gaming atmosphere.
