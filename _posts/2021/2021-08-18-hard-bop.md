Hard bop developed in the mid-1950s as an extension of bebop, incorporating a stronger influence from blues, gospel, and R\&B to add more groove and soul to the complex bebop vocabulary. It is sometimes closely associated with soul jazz, blending intricate improvisation with earthy, emotional expressiveness.

Hank Mobley was a tenor saxophonist known for his smooth tone and sophisticated style, while Sonny Rollins’s powerful and inventive playing pushed hard bop’s boundaries. Charles Mingus, a bassist and composer, added his unique voice with emotionally charged compositions that remain essential to the genre.
