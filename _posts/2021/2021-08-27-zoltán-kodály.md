Zoltán Kodály was a Hungarian composer, ethnomusicologist, pedagogue, linguist, and philosopher. His Sonata in B minor for solo cello, Op. 8, written in 1915, stands as one of the most important works for solo cello since Bach’s Cello Suites. The piece showcases Kodály’s deep understanding of the cello’s capabilities, blending virtuosic technique with rich emotional expression.

The sonata was first performed in 1918 and published in 1921, and it remains a staple of the solo cello repertoire, admired for its innovative use of folk elements and modernist harmonies.

Here is a compelling performance of the third movement by cellist Sebastian Bäverstam:
