Dungeon synth is a subgenre of electronic music characterized by its evocative soundscapes that draw on themes of fantasy and medieval settings. Typically created with synthesizers, keyboards, and drum machines, this genre emphasizes ambient and orchestral textures. Dungeon synth often serves as a storytelling medium, conjuring imagery inspired by mythology, literature (notably the works of J.R.R. Tolkien), and tabletop RPGs like Dungeons & Dragons. The genre was first named on March 17, 2011, by Andrew Werdna in his Dungeon Synth Blog.

Emerging in the early to mid-1990s, dungeon synth has roots in the Norwegian Black Metal scene, with artists like Mortiis and Varg Vikernes incorporating ambient elements into their work. Following a decline in the 2000s, the genre has seen a resurgence since the early 2010s, driven by online communities and platforms like Bandcamp. Today, artists experiment with various moods within the genre, giving rise to substyles such as Winter Synth and Comfy Synth, which explore colder and cozier soundscapes, respectively.
