Power Metal is one of metal’s most theatrical subgenres—stylistically high fantasy, musically high fidelity.

The genre crystallized in the mid-1980s, particularly in Germany and Scandinavia, building on the melodic legacy of NWOBHM and early proto-power acts like Rainbow and Manowar. Faster tempos, harmonized guitars, and soaring tenor vocals became genre staples, often supplemented by keyboards to heighten the epic scale. Lyrical themes consistently draw from mythology, fantasy literature, and hero narratives. Musicologist Robert Walser and anthropologist Sam Dunn both note the influence of Ronnie James Dio, whose work helped standardize the genre’s metaphorical and vocal language.
