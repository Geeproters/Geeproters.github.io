*Altre Follie (1500–1750)* is a curated journey through two centuries of early European music, centered on the enduring theme of “La Folia”—a harmonic pattern that traveled across borders and styles.

Performed by HESPÈRION XXI under the direction of Jordi Savall, the collection showcases historical instruments and performance practices drawn from Renaissance and Baroque traditions. The album is loosely chronological, tracing how “La Folia” and related forms adapted across regions, from courtly dances to creolized interpretations in the Americas. Savall’s ensemble is known for its rigorous yet expressive approach, reviving repertoire often lost to the archive.
