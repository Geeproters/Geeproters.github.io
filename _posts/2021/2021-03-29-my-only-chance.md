*Furi* is 2016 shoot 'em up boss-rush action game developed by The Game Bakers. It focuses on fast-paced combat and precise timing, requiring players to learn each boss's unique patterns to survive. The gameplay combines hack-and-slash mechanics with bullet-hell elements.

The game's electronic, synth-heavy soundtrack features contributions from artists like Carpenter Brut, Waveshaper, Lorn, and The Toxic Avenger, and is a defining element of the game.

Hereâ€™s *My Only Chance*, from the *Furi* OST by The Toxic Avenger:
