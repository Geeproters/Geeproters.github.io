I've talked about Kikuo a few times in the past. My favorite vocaloid producer. Generally mixes dark cabaret and prog pop with various electronic techniques. Playful sounding music with dark subject matter. Anyway, when he doesn't use Miku's voice, he'll occasionally bring in a real singer. Here's a 2017 track where he does exactly that.
