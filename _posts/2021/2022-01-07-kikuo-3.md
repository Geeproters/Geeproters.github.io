Kikuo is a vocaloid producer known for blending dark cabaret and progressive pop with electronic elements. His music often sounds playful but explores dark, complex themes. While he frequently uses Hatsune Miku’s voice, he occasionally features real singers to add different textures to his work.

This 2017 track showcases this approach, combining Kikuo’s signature style with a live vocalist for a unique, haunting effect. His ability to mix lighthearted melodies with unsettling subjects makes him stand out in the vocaloid and electronic music scenes.
