Connecticut duo WHOKILLEDXIX—formerly known simply as XIX—comprise Yung Skayda and Karm the Tool, and are key figures in the emergence of Digicore. The genre, named by Lonelee of Teardrop Digital in the late 2010s, is a branch of hip hop marked by synthetic maximalism and high-pitched, autotuned vocals delivered in breathy, fast-paced flows.

Digicore draws from trap and EDM alike, with glitchy vocal stutters, distorted bass, and layered synth textures. Many of its producers transitioned from 2010s dance music, bringing an ear for glamour and energy to a new, hyper-online generation of rap.
