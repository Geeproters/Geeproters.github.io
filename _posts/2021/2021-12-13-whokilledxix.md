Connecticut punk/hip-hop duo WHOKILLEDXIX (formerly XIX). The duo, made up of Yung Skayda and Karm The Tool, Create Digicore music. 
Digicore is a form of Hip Hop that developed in the late 2010s. The genre name was coined by artist and record label founder, Lonelee of Teardrop Digital. It is characterized by synthesized, bombastic, and glamourous production, commonly featuring layered, maximalist synth work and noisy basslines and rhythms/percussion derived from Trap, all of which serve to accompany highly melodious, auto-tuned, and hi-pitched vocal performances, usually done with breathy voice singing and sing-rapping. It frequently, though not always, features a distinctive style of vocal "glitching" or "stuttering", a vocal production technique/effect that takes the form of chopped-up, heavily processed vocal bits cut into short parts and pitched up in accordance with the melody. Furthermore, vocalists of the genre commonly utilize fast-paced, animated, and frenzied flows, resulting in a distinct, highly energetic sound. Producers often take influences from a wide, eclectic array of Electronic Dance Music genres (with many of the genres' producers having previously produced 2010s EDM) or even from Rock and Pop.
