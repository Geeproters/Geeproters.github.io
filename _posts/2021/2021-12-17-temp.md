It's been just over a year since I started these posts. Today, Iâ€™m sharing statistics on the genres covered so far, based on how many times the relevant artist is mentioned. Reading through this, I can see that several genres are covered disproportionately frequently or infrequently. I'll think about doing more on genres like folk, world, and rock subgenres, and perhaps less soundtrack music.

**Notes:**

* *Misc Electronica* mainly includes artists who work across genres, especially soundtrack composers like Kevin Penkin, plus sound collage.
* *Ambient* covers various subgenres like nature, dark-nature, space, tribal ambient, and drone music. Some soundtrack-only subgenres (e.g., ambient space country from Rimworld or Firefly) are still categorized under *Soundtrack*.
* Rarely mentioned microgenres (Shibuya-Kei, psybreak, folktronica, etc.) were either spread across genres or excluded from this list.
* When artists span multiple genres, I generally assign them to the most fitting one.
* Single-mention genres not listed above include reggae, power noise, footwork, baroque pop, hardvapor, plunderphonics, goblincore, witch house, skweee, nu-disco, nu-jazz, neurofunk, bitpop, and others.
* Breakbeat is excluded as a genre, though some recommendations focus on breakbeats.
