Korla Pandit, born John Roland Redd, was an American musician known for his mastery of the Hammond organ. In the late 1940s, Redd adopted the persona of Korla Pandit, presenting himself as a French-Indian musician from New Delhi while actually being a light-skinned African-American from Missouri. His show *Korla Pandit's Adventures In Music* was the first all-music program on television, and he earned the title "Godfather of Exotica" for his pioneering work in blending world sounds with organ music.

Rhoda Scott is an American soul-jazz organist famous for her clean, innovative playing style. On her 1972 performance of the jazz standard “Moanin’,” she uses unconventional techniques like clawing the keys with one hand while playing pedals barefoot—a habit started during her church organ days.

The track “Misirlou” is a folk song from the Eastern Mediterranean with roots in the Ottoman Empire, played by Arabic, Greek, and Jewish musicians since the 1920s. Its surf rock version by Dick Dale, known as "The King of the Surf Guitar," brought Middle Eastern scales and heavy reverb into American rock music.
