Often associated with the dreampunk movement, 輕描淡寫 (Lightly Written) creates ambient music rooted in hazy nostalgia and nocturnal soundscapes. Their work overlaps with hypnagogic pop and hauntology—genres that evoke memory through faded textures and references to 1980s media culture.

This album blends atmospheric synth layers with field recordings (notably rain), producing a sense of drifting through a dreamlike cityscape after dark.

Very atmospheric.
