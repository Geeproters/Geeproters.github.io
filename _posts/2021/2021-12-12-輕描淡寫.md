Here's an ambient album from 輕描淡寫. Very atmospheric.
 輕描淡寫 : 小圈子

This specific artist/album has been associated with "dreampunk" ambience, their music also being likened to Hypnagogic pop (hauntology), ie. evoking cultural memory and nostalgia for the popular entertainment of the past (principally the 1980s). The album features haunting synth soundscapes with nocturnal field recordings, along with a general theme of rain.
