Yo-Yo Ma is a world-renowned cellist, celebrated for his extraordinary technique, warm tone, and broad musical versatility. Born in Paris in 1955 to Chinese parents, he began studying the cello at the age of four and quickly gained recognition as a prodigy. Over his prolific career, Ma has recorded more than 90 albums, won 19 Grammy Awards, and collaborated with artists across a wide range of genres, including classical, bluegrass, tango, and traditional Asian music.

His repertoire spans from Bach's cello suites to contemporary works, always marked by a deep musicality and emotional expressiveness. Beyond performance, Ma is known for his humanitarian efforts and projects like the Silk Road Ensemble, which promotes cultural exchange through music.

Here he performs *The Swan* from Camille Saint-Saëns' *The Carnival of the Animals*, a lyrical and graceful piece that beautifully showcases the cello's singing qualities, accompanied by pianist Kathryn Stott.
