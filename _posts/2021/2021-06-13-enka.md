The next 3 entries will be Enka songs.

Enka is a genre of Japanese popular music that draws heavily from traditional Japanese musical styles. Modern enka is relatively recent development, maintaining a vocal style that’s closer to older, more traditional forms than other popular genres like ryūkōka, which was more prevalent before World War II.

The origins of enka date back to the Meiji Era (1868–1912), when it began as a form of political expression. During this time, Japan's first political party was formed, but party leaders were banned from speaking to the public. Instead, they used songs of political satire, which were sung on the streets by performers.

Enka evolved throughout the Showa Era, particularly after the war, shifting away from its political roots. It became known for its deeply emotional lyrics, nostalgic themes, and its emphasis on reflecting Japan’s traditional values. Today, while not be as widespread as it once was, enka still resonates with many, especially older generations.

Here's a track originally from 1983 by Hashi Yukio
