Symphonic Metal merges the scale of classical orchestration with the intensity of metal—operatic vocals, cinematic arrangements, and distorted guitars share equal billing.

As a cross-generic style, it appears across subgenres but gained distinct form in the 1990s, particularly in Europe. Drawing from gothic and death metal foundations, bands began integrating full orchestras or synthesized equivalents, often alongside classically trained vocalists. While precursors existed in the 1980s, it was bands like Therion and Nightwish who standardized the genre’s sonic palette: choral textures, string sections, and counterpoint layered over metal riffing.
