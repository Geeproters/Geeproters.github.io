Here are some of my favorite tracks from the soundtrack of Monument Valley 2. The music is primarily a mix of jazz fusion and ambient electronica. Most of the tracks fall under the umbrella term of digital fusion, as they often consist of acoustic parts with electronic accompaniments, or instrumental parts with electronic effects added in post. Incredible stuff.
