Seamus Rawles Malliagh, known by his stage name Iglooghost, is an English electronic music producer based in London. He's the second artist I've talked about whose works can often be classified as "wonky," (meaning unstable beats, and a blend of genres including hip hop, electro-funk, chiptune, jazz fusion, glitch, and crunk) the first being Snail's House. His music could also be described as "Deconstructed club," or post-club, electronic dance music characterized as a post-modernist counterpart to house and techno. You can definitely hear lots of Hyperpop influence, some future bass, and nu-jazz too.
