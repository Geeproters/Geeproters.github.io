Seamus Rawles Malliagh, known as Iglooghost, is an English electronic music producer based in London. His work frequently falls into the “wonky” category—characterized by off-kilter beats and a fusion of genres including hip hop, electro-funk, chiptune, glitch, and jazz fusion. His sound also intersects with “deconstructed club,” a genre that reimagines dance music through a postmodern lens, breaking apart traditional house and techno structures. Influences from Hyperpop, future bass, and nu-jazz are also present in his dense, hyper-detailed compositions.

One of the most intricate and experimental IDM albums featured here since Culprate’s *Deliverance*.
