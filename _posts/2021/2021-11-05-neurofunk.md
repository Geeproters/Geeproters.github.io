Neurofunk is a dark subgenre of drum and bass which emerged between 1997 and 1998 in London, England as a progression of the techstep of the mid-1990s. Techstep emerged from the Drum and bass / techno music of the early 1990s. Here's a 1995 album from T Power, a record producer who worked in the UK hardcore scene, before moving onto jungle. This album was produced in the transition period of the previously mentioned genres, so you can hear aspects of what people today would call neurofunk, as well as the elements of what was popular in techstep and DnB from the time.
