Neurofunk is a dark subgenre of drum and bass that emerged in London around 1997-1998, evolving from mid-90s techstep. Techstep itself grew out of early 90s drum and bass and techno scenes. 

This 1995 album by T Power was created during that transitional period, blending elements that would later define neurofunk with sounds popular in techstep and drum and bass at the time.
