Mushroom Jazz is a compilation series curated by DJ Mark Farina, released on cassette in 1992 and later on CD and vinyl in 1997. Blending downtempo, hip hop, jazz, R&B, and Latin influences, Farina mixes tracks together with smooth beatmatching to create a laid-back, eclectic vibe. Great for when you're looking for something fresh but mellow. Here are the first four volumes:
