*Castlevania* is a long-running video game series centered on the vampire-hunting Belmont family and their battles with Dracula and other supernatural foes. The series is generally set in a dark, gothic world inspired by classic horror.

The series' soundtracks are known for their moody and atmospheric tones, matching the games' settings. The compositions often draw from baroque and classical music, while later titles introduced elements of rock, hip-hop, and jazz.
