While I'm at it I might as well do another one. Here's White Tiger Field (白虎野, Byakkoya), the tenth solo album by Susumu Hirasawa. Two of its songs were featured in the 2006 anime film Paprika. He incorporates elements of choral music, symphonic rock, and sound collage into the genres he would commonly work in and had grown accustomed to; electronica, rock, prog, ambient, and experimental. Imo, this one ended up having some of his most interesting sound of any of his works but was also refined to the likes of Technique of Relief and Siren - which Hirasawa felt he already perfected both his vocal style and the "simulated world music" concept with.
