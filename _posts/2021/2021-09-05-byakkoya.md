*White Tiger Field* (白虎野, Byakkoya) is the tenth solo album by Susumu Hirasawa. Released in 2006, two of its songs were featured in the anime film *Paprika*. Hirasawa blends choral music, symphonic rock, and sound collage with his signature styles: electronica, rock, prog, ambient, and experimental. This album showcases some of his most interesting sound design, while maintaining the refined vocal style and "simulated world music" concept perfected in his earlier works *Technique of Relief* and *Siren*.
