Heitor Villa-Lobos (1887–1959) fused European modernism with Brazilian folk traditions, creating a body of work that defies easy categorization yet remains central to Latin American concert music.

A prolific composer, Villa-Lobos wrote across nearly every genre, but his music for guitar and voice remains especially influential. *Suite Popular Brasileira*, originally for solo guitar, reflects his synthesis of urban popular styles—like choro and modinha—with formal classical technique. Elsewhere, his *Bachianas Brasileiras* series pays tribute to Bach while weaving in native rhythms and textures. These recordings highlight both his structural invention and cultural hybridity.
