The esraj (alt. Israj) is an Indian stringed instrument. It is a relatively recent instrument, being only about 300 years old. Along with the Dilruba, a less modern variant, the two instruments can be found throughout the Indian subcontinent. The esraj is found more commonly in North India, primarily Punjab, where it is used in Sikh music and Hindustani classical compositions and in West Bengal. "Bhairavi (Hindi: भैरवी, Urdu: بَھیرَوی ‎, Sindhi: راڳ ڀيروي) is a Hindustani Classical heptatonic (Sampurna) raga of Bhairavi thaat. In Western musical terms, raga Bhairavi employs the notes of the Phrygian mode, one of the traditional European church modes. Bhairavi is often described as the ‘queen of ragas’. It takes its name from the Hindu goddess of destruction, and conjures versatile moods. To some it can evoke ‘awe, terror, and chaos’; to others ‘a pleasant sobering atmosphere of love and piety’. It is played at sunrise, or alternatively as the final piece in a concert." Here's a performance by Arshad Khan, in which he demonstrates both the esraj, and Bhairavi.
