The esraj (also spelled Israj) is a relatively modern Indian stringed instrument, about 300 years old, closely related to the Dilruba. It's mainly found in North India—especially Punjab, where it’s central to Sikh music—and in West Bengal.  

The esraj is often used to perform *Raga Bhairavi*, a classical Hindustani raga known as the “queen of ragas.” Bhairavi corresponds roughly to the Phrygian mode in Western music and conveys a wide range of emotions, from awe and chaos to love and devotion. Traditionally played at sunrise or as a concert finale, it honors the Hindu goddess of destruction and inspires both intensity and serenity.

Here’s a beautiful demonstration by Arshad Khan, showcasing the esraj and the evocative power of Bhairavi.
