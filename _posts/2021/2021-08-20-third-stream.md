Third stream is a music genre that is a fusion of jazz and classical music. The term was coined in 1957 by composer Gunther Schuller in a lecture at Brandeis University. Orchestral Jazz is, as the name would imply, a fusion of jazz's rhythmic and instrumental characteristics with the scale and structure of an orchestra. The genre arose in the 1920s. Here's one album that falls into both categories by Miles Davis, paired with arranger and composer Gil Evans:

Evans is recognized as one of the greatest orchestrators in jazz and playing an important role in the development of cool jazz, modal jazz, free jazz, and jazz fusion.
