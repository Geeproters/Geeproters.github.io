Third stream is a genre that blends jazz improvisation and rhythms with the compositional techniques and forms of classical music. Coined in 1957 by composer Gunther Schuller during a lecture at Brandeis University, the term highlights a "third way" beyond jazz and classical traditions.

Orchestral jazz, closely related, combines jazz’s characteristic swing and instrumental timbres with the scale and complexity of orchestral arrangements. This style dates back to the 1920s and often features large ensembles with intricate scores.

A landmark album that embodies both third stream and orchestral jazz is Miles Davis’s *Sketches of Spain* (1960), arranged and orchestrated by Gil Evans. Evans is widely regarded as one of jazz’s greatest orchestrators, instrumental in shaping cool jazz, modal jazz, free jazz, and jazz fusion through his innovative arrangements.
