I'll try to make this the last Susumu Hirasawa entry for a while.  

From his 1994 album *Aurora*:  
**Love Song**  
[https://youtu.be/GfrLSWXAx1Q](https://youtu.be/GfrLSWXAx1Q)

*English Lyrics excerpt:*  
That calling voice dyes the skies a vermilion hue  
The falling rain goes on for miles and miles  
It cries like an angel that fostered a thousand dreams in the silent night  
That voice, That voice...

This song, along with *High-Minded Castle*, was released free of charge as a protest against the Iraq War. Hirasawa's singing here is very subdued, yet the lyrics carry powerful, heartfelt messages.

From his 2003 album *Blue Limbo*:  
**High Minded Castle**  
[https://youtu.be/x8MTeqf--_M](https://youtu.be/x8MTeqf--_M) 

*English Lyrics excerpt:*  
On an angry hill, the moaning wind fades the flowers of rage  
You answer faint voices of children in the farthest land  
From sinfully shining machines, fake day and unmerciful fire are spun out like a rumbling avalanche...  

The song explores themes of war, loss, and the resilience of hope amid destruction. Both tracks stand out in Hirasawa's discography for their deeply political and emotional content.
