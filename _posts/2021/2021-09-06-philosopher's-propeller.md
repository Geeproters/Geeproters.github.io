Here are two atmospheric works by Susumu Hirasawa:

[Susumu Hirasawa - Nigredo](https://youtu.be/_i7Ixk82yLQ)  

[Susumu Hirasawa - Philosopher's Propeller 1 (Philosopher's Propeller)](https://youtu.be/JzfrOxngoBs)  

*Philosopher's Propeller* (賢者のプロペラ, Kenja no Puropera) is Hirasawa's eighth solo album and the first to be completely self-released. The album draws inspiration from Myanmar alchemy, with several track titles referencing Latin terms related to the alchemical *magnum opus* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnum_opus_(alchemy)). This work is very atmospheric and immersive.
