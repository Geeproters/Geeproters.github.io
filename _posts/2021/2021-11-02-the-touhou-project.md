The Touhou Project, or simply Touhou, is a popular bullet hell shoot 'em up series created by the independent Japanese developer Team Shanghai Alice, essentially a one-man operation by ZUN. The series is well known not only for its challenging gameplay but also for its memorable and widely beloved soundtrack.

Here are some standout tracks from the Touhou games:

Cafe de Touhou is a beloved series of doujin albums by DDBY, featuring smooth jazz instrumental arrangements of Touhou themes from volumes 1 through 8. Their work reimagines the original game music in a relaxing, lounge style:
