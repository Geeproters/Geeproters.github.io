Patrick Driscoll, professionally known as Blank Banshee (also Shinjuku MAD), is a Canadian electronic musician and producer hailing from Saint John, New Brunswick. He gained widespread recognition with his 2012 album *Blank Banshee 0*, which innovatively fused vaporwave’s nostalgic, ambient textures with the rhythmic elements of trap music, giving rise to the subgenre known as vaportrap. His sound strikes a balance between abstract atmospheric ambience and danceable beats.

In 2019, Blank Banshee released *Metamorphosis*, a concept album that expands on his signature style by integrating intricate IDM influences and diverse instrumentation. Notably, the tracks flow seamlessly into one another, embodying the album’s theme of transformation and evolution.
