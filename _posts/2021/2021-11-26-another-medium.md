Here’s *Another Medium* in a few other mediums.

Originally composed by Toby Fox for *Undertale* (2015), this track plays during the Hotland section and features a distinctive shifting meter and warm synth textures that contrast the mechanical setting. It’s one of the most frequently covered and remixed songs from the game’s OST, showing up in all kinds of arrangements—from classical to meme.

A nice example of how flexible and beloved game music can be—across genres *and* formats.
