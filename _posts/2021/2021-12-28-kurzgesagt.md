The soundtracks from Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell, composed by Munich-based studio Epic Mountain, are more than just background music—they're immersive, atmospheric pieces in their own right.

Epic Mountain’s style blends ambient electronica with cinematic textures, often featuring soft piano, synth pads, and occasional string flourishes. Their work subtly supports Kurzgesagt’s science storytelling, but outside of that context, it holds up as contemplative, moody listening—especially for work or winding down.

An introspective piece with ambient strings and restrained synth work.
