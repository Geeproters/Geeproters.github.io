Japanese jazz keyboardist Mikio Masuda emerged from the Osaka club scene in the early 1970s, carving out a distinctive space in electric jazz and fusion. A self-taught multi-instrumentalist, his work bridges modal jazz, funk, and experimental synth textures.

“Let’s Get Together” appears across three albums between 1976 and 1979—each version reflecting a shift in style and instrumentation. The earliest, from *Mickey’s Mouth* (1976), is spare and slow-burning, led by exploratory synth tones. By *Moon Stone* (1978), the track adopts a tighter, groove-driven fusion feel with clearer melodic structure. The 1979 version on *Corazón* reinterprets the piece again, this time folding in Latin jazz elements and a more syncopated rhythmic base.
