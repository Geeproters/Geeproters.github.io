Mikio Masuda (born 1949) is a Japanese jazz and jazz fusion keyboardist. Largely self-taught, Masuda played bass at the age of 16, before switching to piano and performing in various clubs in Osaka. Here are three versions of his song "Let's Get Together," recorded in different years on different albums. It can be interesting hearing the similarities and differences between the two, the first focusing on a much slower groove and with a more experimental synth sound, the second sounding a bit more like traditional funk/jazz fusion, and the third with another very interesting jazz sound.
