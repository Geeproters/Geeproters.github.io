Folktronica is a genre of electronic music that combines acoustic instrumentation with contemporary and traditional folk elements. It often features acoustic guitars and string instruments, blending these sounds with the compositional techniques of IDM and glitch music, along with the tempo and ambiance of downtempo.

Although producers began experimenting with acoustic elements in the 1990s, folktronica gained traction in the early 2000s, with the term used to describe the works of artists like Four Tet and groups such as The Books and Tunng. Folktronica is stylistically diverse. Some artists adhere to traditional song structures or incorporate live instrumentation, while others focus exclusively on samples for a more experimental sound.

What unifies all forms of folktronica is the harmonious blend of electronic and acoustic instrumentation, resulting in rich, contrasting textures. I love this kind of blend of acoustic and electronic elements (in any form, not just folktronica).

Four Tet is an English electronic musician who helped pioneer the genre. In 2001, Four Tet released his second album, Pause, through Domino Recording Company. In this album, Hebden incorporated more folk elements and electronic samples, leading the media and press to label the style as "folktronica."

Here are two standout tracks from Four Tet's 2003 album Rounds:
