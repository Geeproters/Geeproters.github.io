Progressive metal is a genre that merges metal's amplified, virtuosic guitar-driven sound with song structure and technically-proficient progressive rock. This style is characterized by unorthodox songwriting that includes complex harmonies, multiple sections, tempo shifts, uncommon time signatures, and additional instrumentation like keyboards. The lyrics often lean towards cleanly sung vocals with poetic, melancholic, and introspective themes, delving into subjects such as philosophy, science fiction, and politics.

The roots of progressive metal can be traced back to the 1970s, drawing influence from progressive rock bands like King Crimson and Rush, which embraced ambitious songwriting styles featuring changes in meter and extended song lengths. Additionally, bands like Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, and Mercyful Fate contributed to the genre by incorporating more complex compositions, heavier riffs, and power chord-based songwriting.
