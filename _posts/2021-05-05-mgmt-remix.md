One of my personal favorites from MGMT is a mix by Cornelius. The track has a nice clarity to Andrew VanWyngarden's voice:

Keigo Oyamada, known by his moniker Cornelius, is a Japanese musician and producer who co-founded Flipper's Guitar, an influential Shibuya-kei band, before embarking on a solo career. His 1997 album *Fantasma* received praise from American critics, with comparisons to Brian Wilson and Beck.

I'll talk more about the ambient pioneer Brian Eno at a later date.
