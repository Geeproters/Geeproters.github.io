Another choral piece I like:

[Miserere mei, Deus - Allegri - Tenebrae conducted by Nigel Short](https://youtu.be/H3v9unphfi0)

Miserere mei, Deus is a setting of Psalm 51 (starting "Have mercy upon me, O God") by Italian composer Gregorio Allegri, composed in the 1630s for exclusive use of the Sistine Chapel's Tenebrae services during Pope Urban VIII's reign. The piece features two choirs—one with five voices and the other with four—alternating in their singing and joining together for the conclusion. It is one of the most recognized examples of polyphony, generally performed in a 9-part arrangement.
