Psybient is a form of Chillout music that emerged in the mid-1990s as Psytrance and Goa Trance artists began composing slower, more relaxed tracks that emphasized atmosphere over rhythm. The genre blends the hypnotic, surreal, and progressive atmosphere of psytrance with the ambient soundscape, often paired with the laid-back grooves of Downtempo. Labels like Twisted and Ultimae Records helped define psybient beyond its psytrance roots, with notable groups such as Shpongle, Carbon Based Lifeforms, and Younger Brother.

Carbon Based Lifeforms are a well-known Swedish electronic music duo formed in 1996 in Gothenburg by Johannes Hedberg and Daniel Segerstad. Hereâ€™s an album from 2010, *Interloper*, which is my favorite from them.

Very spacey vibes, reminding me of games like FTL and Mass Effect.
