I've listened to several traditional Irish folk songs, and Dúlamán remains one of my favorites. This song has been recorded numerous times over the years. 

My favorite is Celtic Woman's version from 2016,

Last year's rendition by The Choral Scholars of University College Dublin surprised me an excellent recording and performance.
