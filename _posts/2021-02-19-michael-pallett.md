Michael James Owen Pallett is a Canadian composer, violinist, keyboardist, and vocalist who performs solo as Owen Pallett or, before 2010, under the name Final Fantasy. While his style is often categorized as indie rock, some of his albums lean more toward “baroque pop,” a fusion genre combining rock with elements of classical music. It could also be called chamber pop, a genre based on the smooth and melodic songwriting of Lounge and other Easy Listening, as well as the orchestration of Baroque Pop and the production styles of other 1960s pop genres. 

His album, "He Poos Clouds" (2006), showcases lots of quirky and interesting musical ideas. The strings, vocals, keys, and percussion are all performed by him.

Here’s "He Poos Clouds" by Final Fantasy:
