Lorn is another American electronic musician who I've been listening to for a while. He creates downtempo IDM. IDM, Intelligent Dance Music, is often more suited for home listening than the club scene as compared to its more conventional counterpart Electronic Dance Music (EDM). His work also takes from ambient electronica. 

In recent years, numerous tracks by Lorn have amassed tens of millions of views, with his most famous track, Acid Rain, reaching 67,598,393 views at the time of writing. This track was my introduction to Lorn. 

His albums - Ask the Dust, Nothing Else, Vessel, and REMNANT - are all worth a listen.
