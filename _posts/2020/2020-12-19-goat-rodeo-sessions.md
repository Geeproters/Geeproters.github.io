Continuing with the progressive bluegrass theme from the previous entry:

The Goat Rodeo Sessions is a 2011 collaborative album featuring several exceptionally accomplished musicians, including Stuart Duncan on violin, Yo-Yo Ma on cello, Edgar Meyer on double bass, and Chris Thile on mandolin. This album won Grammy Awards for Best Folk Album and Best Engineered Album.

Here's my favorite track off the album:
