For those seeking quality and underlistened jazz and jazz fusion, Marcel The Drunkard on YouTube is a great resource. He compiles jazz, funk, fusion, world music, and more. Here are a couple of standout albums I discovered through his channel:

[Bad News Botanists - Venomous Nightshade (full album) [Jazz Fusion] [USA, 2017]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmb5yjZnZdI)  

[Marutyri - Inner Movements (full album) [Jazz Fusion] [Netherlands, 2016]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxyKHmVPUk0)
