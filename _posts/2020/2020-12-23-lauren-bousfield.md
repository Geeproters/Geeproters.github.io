Lauren Bousfield has made a name for herself under various aliases, including Beautiful Mutants, Nero's Day at Disneyland, and most recently, simply as Lauren Bousfield. She’s remained one of my favorite electronic artists since discovering her music early last year.

Bousfield works primarily in the genres of glitch, IDM, and breakcore. Breakcore is a genre of EDM that combines Hardcore elements with intricate, often chaotic breakbeats at high tempos, drawing inspiration from Jungle and Drum and Bass. It typically features extensive sampling and a complex sound palette. She often experiments with the genre, for example by slowing down these elements while incorporating emotional but complex melodic lines.

Here's Sprawling Idiot Effigy, the final track from From Rotting Fantasylands:

Avalon Vales, a later album, is a little less abrasive than From Rotting Fantasylands but is arguably more emotive. I've timestamped my favorite track below, but it’s definitely worth a full start-to-finish:
