The Clash was an English rock band formed in London in 1976. As a pivotal figure in the original wave of British punk rock, they played a significant role in the subsequent post-punk and new wave movements. Their music incorporated elements from various genres, including reggae, dub, funk, ska, and rockabilly.

The band's integration of ska and reggae, along with their connection to England's Jamaican subculture, significantly influenced the emergence of the 2 Tone movement following the punk explosion.
