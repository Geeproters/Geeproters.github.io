Synthwave, also known as outrun, draws inspiration from the retro-futurism of the 1980s and shares many traits with French house and Italo disco. It is one of the more prominent micro-genres of electronic music.

Perturbator and Carpenter Brut are two popular French synthwave artists. 

Here are a couple of their most popular albums:
