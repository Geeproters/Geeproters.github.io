Sons of Kemet is a British group that fuses Afrobeat and jazz. They have a vibrant and dynamic sound. Their 2018 album, Your Queen Is A Reptile, is filled with personality, emotion, and depth. The band showcases a remarkable command of West African vocal and rhythmic styles, incorporating chanted lyrics, polyrhythms, and intricate percussive elements.

This is one of my favorite Afrobeat releases of recent years for its innovative approach and unique cultural resonance as a London-based ensemble.
