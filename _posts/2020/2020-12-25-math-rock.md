Math rock is a genre characterized by intricate rhythmic patterns, angular chords, and unconventional melodic structures. I consider the style to be particularly distinctive against the many others which arose from the advent of prog and indie rock in the late '80s. It is characterized by intricate guitar work, complex rhythms, and unconventional time signatures. Here are some noteworthy albums that exemplify the genre:

[Covet - shibuya (feat. San Holo)](https://youtu.be/ry7eZJ6qTS4?list=PLRPIdEPgTyNRNrMkrQ8JbMlViklOdW4Wt)  
This track showcases impressive technicality while remaining accessible.

[Polyphia - New Levels New Devils [Full Album]](https://youtu.be/H2j2gGqRXxI?t=1786)  
A more hardcore and abrasive take on the genre.

[American Football - American Football (LP1) [FULL ALBUM STREAM]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZNYVt87y60)  
Heavily featuring vocals, this album leans towards the Midwest emo style while delivering excellent riffs.
