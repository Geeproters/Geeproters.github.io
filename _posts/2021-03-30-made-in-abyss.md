Kevin Penkin is an immensely versatile soundtrack composer, and also among my favorites. His work is influenced by Classical, Chamber, EDM, IDM, EBM, Ambient, Electronica, and World music. He excels at blending acoustic and electronic elements, which I'm always a fan of.

**2024-11-02 update:**
Kevin Penkin remains one of my favorite soundtrack composers. He's worked on the soundtracks for Made In Abyss, The Apothecary Diaries, Eden (Netflix animated series), Tower of God, Florence, and others, many of which will get entries later. 

At this point, 3 soundtracks for Made In Abyss have been released, compiled here.
