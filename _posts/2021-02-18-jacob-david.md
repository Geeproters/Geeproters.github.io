The rhythmic ambience of Jacob David is more apparent than that of Ibi's or Lavallee's from the last entries. He's a Danish pianist, and his music shares a similar feeling and atmosphere. Here are some of my favorites:

[Jacob David - "Mursejler"](https://youtu.be/C9cj_4nB7NA).

[Jacob David - "Loft"](https://youtu.be/GBrxzfTSxtM).

[Jacob David - "Lillian"](https://youtu.be/2SAARWOGY8M).
