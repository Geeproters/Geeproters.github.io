Ambient is a music genre that emphasizes sound and texture over traditional musical structure, aiming to evoke specific atmospheres. It can incorporate a wide range of sound sources, including acoustic and electronic instruments, samples, and vocals. This genre has roots in various musical styles, with early influences from jazz, minimalism, and experimental music. 

Brian Eno is a pioneer and central figure in ambient music, credited with coining the term in his 1978 album *Ambient 1: Music for Airports*. He defined ambient music as "able to accommodate many levels of listening attention without enforcing one in particular." Eno's innovative approach has profoundly shaped the genre and its subgenres.

Eno's transition to ambient music was influenced significantly by figures like Erik Satie, who created what he termed "furniture music" intended to blend into the background. Eno also acknowledged the influence of avant-garde composer John Cage, known for his concept of using silence and ambient sounds as music, as well as La Monte Young, a pioneer of drone music.
