EX-LYD is a Digital Fusion and EDM producer from Newfoundland and Labrador. Although "Digital Fusion" isn’t a common term for this genre, it’s fitting here. EX-LYD's music blends elements from diverse genres—hip-hop, jazz, drum and bass, and breakbeats—while drawing from various EDM and computer music styles, like Chiptune and House. 

Here are some standout tracks from their album *Chip Heat*:

Since I first heard it a few days ago, *Chip Heat* has quickly become one of my favorite electronic albums. The album is characterized by fast tempos, heavy drums, synths, and an upbeat, chiptune-inspired sound. A lively atmosphere ties the album together.
