Psychedelic breakbeat, often referred to as psybreak, is a form of breakbeat music that emerged in the late 1990s, rooted in the sounds of psychedelic music. In the mid-2000s, the genre evolved into a fusion of breakbeat and psychedelic trance, incorporating breakbeat rhythms into tracks that are heavily influenced by psytrance. The repetitive nature of breakbeat rhythms complements the entrancing qualities of psytrance baselines and synths, resulting in a captivating sound.

Hereâ€™s a mix that leans toward the trance side of psybreak music:
