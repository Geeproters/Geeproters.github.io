*Center of Attention* is the highly regarded debut album from InI, an influential hip-hop group formed in the 1990s, featuring members from the iconic D.I.T.C. (Diggin' in the Crates Crew). Initially shelved, the album became one of the most bootlegged albums in hip-hop history before finally receiving an official release in 2003 as part of *Lost & Found: Hip Hop Underground Soul Classics*, a collection of Pete Rock's mid-1990s production work.

Celebrated for its smooth production and introspective lyrics, *Center of Attention* blends soulful samples with intricate beats. The tracks explore themes of life, struggle, and community.
