Klezmer is a vibrant genre of Jewish folk music originating from the Ashkenazi Jewish community of Eastern Europe. This music is often characterized by its expressive melodies and dance rhythms, making it both joyful and poignant. Klezmer has roots in traditional Jewish celebrations and has evolved over time to incorporate elements from various musical styles, including jazz and classical.

One notable artist in the Klezmer scene is Giora Feidman, an Israeli clarinetist known for his extraordinary control and emotional expression with the instrument. At 84 years old, he continues to perform impress audiences. Here's a track demonstrating his ability to make the clarinet "laugh," which is reflected in his piece titled "Freilach," meaning "happy" or "cheerful" in Yiddish.
