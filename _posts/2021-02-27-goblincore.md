Goblincore is an internet aesthetic and subculture inspired by the folklore of goblins. It embraces the beauty of nature’s imperfections, celebrating elements often overlooked or considered less conventionally beautiful. It highlights creatures like frogs, snails, and other small wildlife, and natural materials such as moss, mud, and mushrooms. Goblincore encourages a carefree appreciation of the wild and unpredictable aspects of the environment, inviting a deeper connection to the less glamorous side of nature.
