Here's Hollow Knight's Hornet Theme on marimba, with xylophone, glockenspiel, timpani, conga, bass drum, bass guitar, cymbal, and piano. There’s an interesting polyrhythm about a minute and a half into this arrangement. I'll add that A polyrhythm is when two or more different rhythmic patterns are played simultaneously, creating a new composite rhythm.
