*Technique of Relief* is a 1998 album by Susumu Hirasawa, a highly influential Japanese artist. With his previous solo album, Siren, Hirasawa believed he had perfected the concept of "simulated world music," which he began exploring with Sim City, along with his post-Aurora vocal style. By the late '90s, he largely ceased experimenting with his musical style, feeling that there were no new developments to pursue in that area. Instead, he turned his attention to creating music for Interactive Live Shows.

Technique of Relief was conceived as a concept album for an interactive live performance. It expands on the broad theme of "restoration of a perfect character" introduced in Scuba. While Scuba focused on reuniting scattered individuals into a cohesive group, Technique of Relief explores the thoughts and experiences of many people merging into a neural network, effectively becoming a single entity.

The idea of the "Green Nerve," which Hirasawa had previously explored, is presented here as the embodiment of a perfected human. The narrative begins with the breakdown of the World Cell, leading to the malfunction of the Green Nerve Network. In this scenario, the Bridge Builder (a representation of Hirasawa) must intervene to restore its functionality.

The album could be described as progressive pop, taking from orchestral and neoclassical new age, and electro-industrial. But that said, Hirasawa's style is very unique, and not quite like anything else. The sound of Technique of Relief is dense and passionate, but sacrifices no atmosphere.
