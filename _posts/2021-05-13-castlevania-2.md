More on Castlevania:

Much of the music from the castlevania series has continued to evolve, with iconic themes being reimagined in various games and contexts. Much of this is thanks to Michiru Yamane's two decades of work at the gaming company Konami.

From the original *Castlevania*, there's the classic theme *Vampire Killer*, which set a strong foundation for the seriesâ€™ soundtrack:

This track has seen numerous arrangements, with newer versions appearing in *Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance* and other games, adding fresh layers while maintaining its memorable feel:

Another enduring piece from the series is *Bloody Tears* originally from Castlevania II, which has also been rehashed in *Super Smash Bros. Ultimate*:
