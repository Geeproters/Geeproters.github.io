RimWorld is a colony simulation game developed by Ludeon Studios, where players manage a group of crash-landed survivors on a distant planet. The game emphasizes storytelling and player choice, with various challenges ranging from resource management to dealing with environmental threats and interpersonal dynamics among colonists.

The soundtrack, composed by Alistair Lindsay, contributes greatly to the game's atmosphere. It takes influence from tribal ambient, country, and ambient Americana. Although the "Space Western" subgenre has existed for decades, recently, Americana has found its way into the soundtracks of several space games and other media. The music evokes themes of exploration and resilience, perhaps reminiscent of the American frontier. As a stylistic choice, it's effective at connecting players to the spirit of adventure and the challenges of forging new paths in uncharted territories.
