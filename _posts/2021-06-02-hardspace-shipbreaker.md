*Hardspace: Shipbreaker*’s OST falls into the "space western" category, similar to *Rimworld*’s soundtrack (mentioned in entry 27). While *Rimworld* leans toward tribal ambient, *Shipbreaker* takes a more straightforward ambient Americana approach.

Other well-known examples of the space western sound include *Cowboy Bebop* and *Firefly*, or *Rebel Galaxy,* though that one adds a rock-infused edge to its soundtrack.
