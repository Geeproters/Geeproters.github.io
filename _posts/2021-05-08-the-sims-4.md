Often, the idea around soundtracks for The Sims has been to match the relaxing, slow paced gameplay of the games.

These soundtracks could be described as easy listening music. In earlier games the OST leaned more toward piano jazz in particular, but Sims 4 is mostly orchestral light music. Additional genres such as disco, rock, pop, and electronica appear during special events or in DLC for the game.

The expansion pack also features Latin jazz inspired themes:
