Timba (or Salsa Cubana) is a modern form of Cuban Music (1990s onwards) that combines Salsa with other genres such as Hip Hop, Disco, Funk, Jazz and Rock. Contrary to regular salsa, timba usually features a "rock" drum-kit and is generally more experimental with unconventional instrumental patterns.

From Maraca's 2002 album "Tremenda Rumba\!"  
[Cast√≠gala](https://youtu.be/0rjjSov0ecw) (elements of the genres mentioned above)  
[Danzon Barroco](https://youtu.be/Jq-4xyvihE4) (more classical elements, hence "Baracco")

This is a diverse genre, and "Tremenda Rumba\!" is a very diverse album that I enjoy greatly.
