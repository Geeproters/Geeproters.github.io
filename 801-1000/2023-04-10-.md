I talked about Tim Hecker's 2013 Ambient Drone album Virgins on rec 436\. About a week ago (2023-04-7), Hecker released a new album, No Highs.

This album can be vaguely split into two halves (except for the first track which takes from both), the first half focusing on electroacoustic ambience, and the second taking from post-minimalism or drone. Below are two tracks from the first and second halves.

Really wonderful textures on here. Builds a nice atmosphere with these beautiful, piercing synths.

Monotony II features Colin Stetson (rec 34), as do a couple other tracks.

The entire album is of a consistently high quality.

Whenever I wanna listen to melancholic, wintry, even apocalyptic electroacoustic ambience, I go to Tim Hecker pretty often. His career in music now spans over 20 years, and I have a feeling this album is one I'll be coming back to particularly often.

I'll also take this chance to mention another of my favorite's from Hecker, Ravedeath, 1972\.

Unsettling, airy piano passages layered with electroacoustic drones and feedback contribute to one of his most powerfully emotive albums. Ghostly and ethereal yet dense at once.
