Hardstep is a subgenre of Drum and Bass that emerged from Jungle and Ragga Jungle in 1994 and became mostly popular latter half of the 90s. The name was coined by Grooverider through his "Hardstep Selection" DJ mixes.

The atmosphere is mostly minimalistic with a signature gritty style of production, a restrained use of samples and greater focus on a less melodic and more bass-driven structure. The synth bass riffs are made from simple, deep and modulated patterns, commonly making use of the Reese bass. Vocal samples are only a complement to enhance the chaotic execution of the music, minimising the use of toasting, rapping, and "rudeboy" samples, proper of ragga jungle. Hardstep productions are based on very compressed jungle drumming; the primary percussive pattern is more accentuated and sparse, with its most distinguishing element being an extensive use of syncopated kick drums sampled in an elaborate way, giving a sense of progression and usually a slightly less chaotic and more hard-hitting sound compared to jungle, thus resulting in a more stripped down and rhythmic "hard to dance" style.
