Capoeira is a martial art originated from Bahia in the northeastern region of Brazil. It first emerged from African slaves in the 19th century, being a practice served as a distraction for the slave owners, who believed the slaves were dancing and partying, while in fact they were training for defensive fighting. The music determines the velocity, rhythm and style of the current fight.

The lyrics cover a wide range of themes, through love stories, jokes or homages to great capoeira's fighters. In most cases, they are long narrative lines, with occasional chorus.

The instruments that accompany capoeira are the berimbau, pandeiro, atabaques and caxixi. Berimbau is a long string instrument that is played with a small stick with three types of tuning, viola (acute), médio (medium) and gunga (bass). Pandeiro is an instrument made of leather coat, used as percussion just like the atabaques and caxixi.
