Tropicália or tropicalismo was a Brazilian counterculture art movement started in São Paulo in 1967 by visual artist Hélio Oiticica, bringing the concept of tropical (nature) and technology together, giving the title of his artwork to the artistic movement. Its most famous aspect was the music, typically a blend of Psychedelic Rock, Psychedelic Pop and Experimental production with Brazilian pop music such as Bossa nova and sometimes orchestral influence coming from Baroque Pop and Sunshine Pop, with the lyrics being left wing-tinted abstract poetry. The style's musical manifesto was Tropicália ou panis et circencis, released in 1968\. Despite the movement having started physically in the Southeast Region, including artists as Os Mutantes, Nara Leão and Rogério Duprat, most of the proponents were from Bahia, including Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Gal Costa and Tom Zé.

The movement came to a quick end when the primary songwriters Caetano and Gil were arrested by Brazil's military dictatorship in December 1968 and later forced into exile to London. Several records in the tropicália style were still released after that year, but by the early 1970s most of the tropicalistas' music became indistinguishable from the popular trends of MPB and the genre came to an end. Reflecting the movement's importance to the history of Brazilian popular music, the main artists of tropicália all remain very popular.
