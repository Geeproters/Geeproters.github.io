Wu-Tang Clan is an American hip hop collective formed in Staten Island, New York City, in 1992\. They are regarded as a highly influential group in hip hop, helping to popularize and develop the East Coast hip hop and hardcore hip hop styles. They are often placed as the best or among the best rap groups of all time.

Here're a few of my favorites from them
