The vanguarda paulista or paulistana was a Brazilian cultural movement that began in the city of São Paulo and lasted from 1979 to 1985\. It united artists of various musical styles who had no access to the established major labels due to their experimental, avant-garde approach. This period was marked by a go-to-market plan in 1980s Brazil, locally known as the "Lost Decade" due to the economic problems faced by the country.

That context obliged artists like Arrigo Barnabé and Grupo Rumo to finance their own experimental MPB records which, through word of mouth marketing, started a trend in the consumption of alternative albums among university students. Followed by other names like Itamar Assumpção, Premê and Língua de Trapo who used to perform at the Lira Paulistana theatre, the movement gained visibility and favourable criticism from the alternative media. Nevertheless, the movement never achieved the commercial success expected by the labels, which led it to its gradual decline.

Nowadays, some of the artists who took part in the vanguarda paulista movement are still active, though without the unity of a cultural movement as existed in the early '80s. New generations of musicians influenced by the compositions of the original movement are now usually labeled as new (paulista) vanguardists.
