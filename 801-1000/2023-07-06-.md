Date of Birth was a Japanese psychedelic pop rock band that formed in 1983\. Initially having a quirky new wave sound, they later branched out into an emotional pop rock style, before eventually developing a style that was entirely electronic based.

Planet Dob (プラネット ドブ) is an obscure multi-genre video game developed by Microvision and published by Hudson that was released for the original Playstation on November 18th, 1999\. It was only released in Japan.

Planet Dob was produced by Date of Birth for their album of the same name (Planet Dob).

Here's that album, released 1999\. Breakbeat, Indietronica.

Archives of their 1999 website classifies Planet Dob as such:  
A masterpiece sent to the world from psychedelic DobStudio, who freely manipulates vintage and techno\! Melody kaleidoscope, acoustic maze, brain activation chill-out sound flood ... Mondo / Lounge / Pop fan super must-listen board\! \!\! Ah \~ it feels good \~\!"
