Salsa dura is a subgenre of Salsa music that appeared between the end of the 1960s and beginning of the 1970s, largely concentrated within the United States area and New York City. This form of salsa was largely represented by musicians working at Fania Records (and Fania All Stars) and other ensembles playing at Jazz clubs around urban nightclubs. Due to its lack of a rigid structure, musicians are able to play jam sessions during live performances. Songs are typically above five minutes in duration and lyrical themes follow around the "barrio" way of life and Latin American traditions.

An earlier work of Héctor Lavoe's, "Lo Mato," a collaboration from 1973\. This is the eighth studio album of Willie Colón & Héctor Lavoe, issued in by Fania Records.

William Anthony Colón Román is an American Salsa musician and social activist. He began his career as a trombonist but also sings, writes, produces and acts. Colón is considered a pioneer of Salsa music and a best-selling artist in the genre, having been a key figure in the nascent New York City scene associated with the legendary Fania Records. He is also noteworthy for having assumed a gangster image in his album covers before it was culturally popular.
