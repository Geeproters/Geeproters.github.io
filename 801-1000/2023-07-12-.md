Samuel Cook, known professionally as Sam Cooke, was an American singer and songwriter. Considered one of the most influential soul artists of all time, Cooke is commonly referred to as the "King of Soul" for his distinctive vocals, pioneering contributions to the genre, and significance in popular music.

Live at the Harlem Square Club, 1963, is Sam Cooke's second live album, and it's a really incredible one. Phenomenal musicianship, immense energy, and Sam Cooke's incredible voice.

Here's my favourite song off the album. Fantastic build-up.
