Bent is a English Downtempo, Trip Hop, Art Pop, Indietronica, Dance-Punk duo consisting of consisting of Neil "Nail" Tolliday and Simon Mills. The duo were initially noted for their ability to create their own mischievous style of recordings by sampling their private record collections.

Here are a few of my favourites from them. These two are from their Best Of album:

[K.I.S.S.E.S](https://youtu.be/ubKobdtJpM4)

This one is from a collection of tracks that didn't make the cut on their other albums, "From the Vaults: 1998 \- 2006". Lots of variety.
