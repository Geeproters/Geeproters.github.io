Late Night Lo-Fi (often stylized as Late Nite Lo-Fi) is a subgenre or style of vaporwave that aims to recreate  and repurpose moods and aesthetics associated with 80s and 90s late night television programming. Public broadcasting channels, local news channels, and late night programming in general in the 80s/90s often employed visuals of spacious cities and flashy lights accompanied by smooth jazz, synth funk, pop, and other palatable "urban-sounding" genres to distinguish a nocturnal mood for their nighttime bumpers and programming as well as create a sense of liveliness. Late Night Lo-Fi takes inspiration from these moods by employing samples of the same genres and visuals of 4:3 CRT TVs, public broadcasts, bustling cities at night, and flashing lights, but including a layer of lofi grain that's created through techniques like looping, distortion, reverberation, and filtering. This contrast aims to pull the feelings of luxury and liveliness into feelings of longing, loneliness and disconnect

Late Night Lo-Fi was likely born out of Broken Transmission or the closely-related Hypnagogic Drift as early landmark releases like Midnight Television see repetitive and looping song structures which paint imagery of half-asleep late night television gazing; however, Late Night Lo-Fi puts more emphasis on standard melody than broken transmission and is not necessarily constrained by looping song structures.

Here's that album, Midnight Television's self-titled 2011 album.
