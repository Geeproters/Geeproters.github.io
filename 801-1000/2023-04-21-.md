Xote is a Brazilian genre and rhythm, characterised by its slow and danceable nature. The genre developed from the original German dance style schottische (a reference to the Scottish Polka, regardless the fact that the genre has no similarity to it), being introduced in Brazil around the mid 17th century. Initially, schottische was performed by the Brazilian aristocracy, but soon it became improved and diffused to the popular culture, with new aspects and characteristics, such as more flexibility and movements, characterising it as the Brazilian genre xote.

The main instruments are somewhat similar to its cousins genres Baião and Forró for the common regional origin. There is the presence of accordion lead, with some percussion instruments like agogô and triangle, which give background base to the sound, performed on a slow and swept rhythm.

Xote was mixed with other existing Brazilians musical genres, originating new derivations from the genre. There are different styles across Brazil, including Xote-carreirinho (Southern style with more Polka dance aspects), Xote-duas-damas (Southern style where two women accompany one man in the dance), Xote-inglês, Xote-bragantino (Northern rhythm adding typical instruments from the region) and Xote-nordestino (conceived by Luiz Gonzaga, faster and march-like sound).
