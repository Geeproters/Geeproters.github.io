Techstep is a Drum and Bass genre best noted for its futuristic, dark and gritty sound, mostly using quantized and compressed drum breaks, distorted bass lines, and a focus on a science fiction influenced atmosphere and sampling sources.

The term was coined by Ed Rush and DJ Trace, who with the rest of the No U-Turn Records artists were the initial developers of the style rooted on the Hardstep sound, making it harder, darker and more aggressive. It was around 1997-1999 where the concept was established as a surging development of drum and bass and, surprisingly for such a bleak and noncommercial sound, became along with Darkstep the dominant sound of the genre, which remained so for years.

Here's a track from Ed Rush and Optical's 1998 darkstep album Wormhole
