Art Punk

Art punk is a combination of stripped-down Punk Rock with "arty" elements of Minimalism, instrumental interplay, elements of Traditional Folk Music, experimentation with Jazz or Funk rhythms, dissonance, and noise experimentation.

From Television's 1977 album Marquee Moon.

This album is ranked \#3 for 1977, \#58 overall on RYM. Not a big fan personally, but I like this track more than the others.
