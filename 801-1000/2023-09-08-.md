Blackgaze is a genre that takes after Atmospheric Black Metal's repetitiveness, harsh instrumentation, and mood-driven sound and fuses it with mellow, dreamy textures and melodic chord progressions of, but not limited to, Shoegaze. Blast beats and double-kick drumming are generally lower in the mix to pronounce the atmospheric guitar-work. Instead of traditional shrieking, blackgaze vocalists often implement the wailing vocal technique. Subject matter most widely deals with anxiety, depression, introspective reflections of the artists, altered states of consciousness, and otherworldly experiences.

Here are a few Blackgaze tracks going from a happy or neutral mood down to a depressive mood:
