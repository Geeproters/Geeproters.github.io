The space rock revival emerged in the late 1980s as Neo-Psychedelia's sound was beginning to broaden from its Post-Punk and Jangle Pop roots, with some acts looking towards 1970s Space Rock for inspiration. The revival's unique sound is in effect a combination of the atmospheric soundscapes of the original space rock style with the simpler and more direct songwriting of the post-punk era, overlaid with fuzzed-out guitars and an array of psychedelic effects, with laid-back or "lazy" instrumental and vocal performances that sometimes draw from Dream Pop. Much of the space rock revival also plays with elements of Raga Rock and Krautrock, with many songs featuring extended, repetitive two-chord vamps to create a hypnotic, trancelike effect, as well as more experimental styles like Minimalism and Drone. As the genre evolved in the early 1990s, it would cross over with and influence the development of Shoegaze as a distinct style.
