Skullstep is a style of Darkstep that emerged in the mid-2000s. It is characterised by repetitious, aggressive, off-beat rhythms often programmed using distorted, harsh, and noisy percussion, blended with the dark and sinister-sounding atmospheres of darkstep. The name “Skullstep” was originally a derisive moniker for darkstep, but it soon came to be used for the more esoteric style of skullstep. Certain producers also implement influences from various styles of Hardcore \[EDM\], Post-Industrial, and even Noise music.

Skullstep was pioneered by Limewax who introduced a syncopated, dotted quarter note drum loop that started the trend, exemplified by early tracks like "Satanina / Emato" and Limewax' EP with SPL We Have Life.
