A Tribe Called Quest was an American hip hop group formed in Queens, New York City, in 1985\. The group is regarded as a pioneer of alternative hip hop, influencing numerous hip hop and R\&B musicians.

They mixed Jazz Rap, Boom Bap, and Socially Conscious lyrics, creating a timeless sound that I come back to whenever I'm in the mood.

Funky, humorous, warm sound.
