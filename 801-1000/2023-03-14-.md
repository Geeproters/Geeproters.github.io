Here are a couple more mashups, instead of soul with hip hop these are both hiphop with hip hop.

DJ Essential's Rakim & Damu the Fudgemunk \- The Master Munk 2.0 combines Rakim, American rapper and record producer who was one half of golden age hip hop duo Eric B. & Rakim, with Damu the Fudgemunk, American hip-hop producer, multi-instrumentalist, DJ, and rapper.

This one may be more interesting having already listeened to either of these artists.

Cookin Soul's Wu-Tang x Cookin Soul \- WU XMAS takes Wu Tang and adds Cooking Soul's (a Spanish producer-DJs duo known separately as Big Size and Zock) own music.
