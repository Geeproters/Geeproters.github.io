Finally, the fourth and contemporary era is marked by Sertanejo universitário, which has its origins in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Sertanejo was already consolidated in the phonographic industry, but sertanejo universitário came as a way of engaging younger listeners and people in urban areas, with catchier melodies, simpler lyrics and a more common use of electric guitar and synthesizer. Pop is still a big influence, and it is seen as a more party and commercially palatable genre.

Marília Mendonça & Maiara & Maraisa's 2021 album Patroas 35%. Again, not a big fan of this poppier sound.

Recently, with the mainstream status of sertanejo universitário, other variants of sertanejo are coming up, such as: Funknejo, which combines elements of sertanejo universitário and Funk brasileiro; feminejo, a scene of sertanejo protagonised by women, such as Marília Mendonça; and queernejo, a scene protagonised by queer / LGBTQ+ people, such as Gabeu. These two last scenes are frequently composed by artists who fight for representation and inclusion in the genre.
