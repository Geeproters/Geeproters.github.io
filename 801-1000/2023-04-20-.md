Maxixe (pronounced Mah-SHEESH) is a name of dance and the genre of music used to accompany to it. It appeared in Rio de Janeiro in the end of the 19th century, at about the same time as the Tango was developing in Argentina and Uruguay. Both genres are often compared and had influenced each other. The name of this genre stems from a city of Maxixe in Mozambique. The dance was developed by black slaves, descendents of Chopi people.

Ernesto Nazareth is the most known composer of maxixe, although he disliked this term and preferred his music to be called "Brazilian tango". Other composers of maxixes are Pat√°pio Silva and Chiquinha Gonzaga.

A maxixe by Altamiro Carrilho, released 1961 (or earlier).
