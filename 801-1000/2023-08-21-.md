Minimal wave was coined as a genre name in retrospect. It makes reference to the most electronic and minimal forms of New Wave, Coldwave, Synthpop and Post-Punk. In its most purely electronic and synth-driven form, it is called Minimal Synth. It is also referred to as synth wave and minimal electronics (instrumental minimal synth).

In comparison to mainstream synthpop, the minimal wave sound is sparse, amateurish, stripped down and lo-fi, using analog synthesisers, drum machines and pre-MIDI electronics. The singing is unconventional, with detached and cold vocals. Minimal wave was mainly developed during the years 1979-85, especially in Belgium, France and Germany. Most bands kept a low profile and a DIY ethic, sometimes releasing self-published cassettes or limited editions by private labels.

Minimal synth strips Minimal Wave even further down. Predominately played with analogue synthesisers and other electronics, often downplaying the use of guitars.

Here are a couple tracks from Not Available, a minimal wave album by The Residents, released 1978
