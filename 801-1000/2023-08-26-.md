Ragga Jungle developed in the early 1990s in London. The genre was influenced off the creations of Michael West, known popularly as Congo Natty and Rebel MC. Sampling from Reggae songs, gunshots and gangster movies are prominent. It is characterised by jungle breakbeats, "rudeboy" lyrics, reggae bass lines and heavy influence from Dub and Ragga, both genres that stem from Jamaica. Most vocalists in the genre are of Jamaican Patoi descent. The genre began to decline in popularity in the UK beginning in 1995 when DJs stopped giving popular songs of the genre airtime. However today, it remains a niche genre among the Internet.

Here's the most popular Ragga Jungle album, Tribute to Haile Selassie I by Michael West under his alias Blackstar, released 1995\.
