Jeffrey Scott Buckley (November 17, 1966 – May 29, 1997), raised as Scott Moorhead, was an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist, and the son of Timothy Charles Buckley III. After a decade as a session guitarist in Los Angeles, Buckley amassed a following in the early 1990s by performing cover songs at venues in East Village, Manhattan, such as Sin-é, while gradually focusing more on his own material. After rebuffing interest from record labels and Herb Cohen—the manager of his father, singer Tim Buckley— he signed with Columbia, recruited a band, and recorded what would be his only studio album, Grace, in 1994\.

The album is ranked \#4 for 1994, \#136 overall on RYM.  
Beautiful voice and singing.

His cover of Hallelujah. I'm a big fan of how well his voice matches the guitar. at parts like 1:44 it becomes almost indistinguishable from the guitar. Very ethereal.
