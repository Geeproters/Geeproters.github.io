Slacker Rock, slowcore's sister scene, emerged during the advent of the American underground scene in the 1980s as a raw, noisy style of Indie Rock. Its name stems from its use of low-fidelity production & recording equipment and a laid-back & unsophisticated attitude of performance, giving it an unclean and distinctly ramshackle sound associated with Generation X "slacker" culture. It is also sometimes known aas just "Lo-Fi."

Developing alongside early-to-mid 1980s Alternative Rock/Indie Pop genres Twee Pop, Jangle Pop, Noise Pop and the New Zealand Dunedin Sound, slacker rock artists take inspiration from the sparsely produced, DIY-ethics exhibited in these styles with a strong emphasis placed on technically inferior/sloppy-sounding recording and musicianship. This is either intentional with the idea to lend the music a certain rough charm or simply due to being performed by underground artists with a lack of facilities and/or equipment (typically making use of 4-track Tascam recorders), money and musical training.

Slacker rock saw its golden period in the 1990s, but countless underground and unsigned bands continue to practice the style, whilst successful artists in the 2010s such as Courtney Barnett, Alex G, and Car Seat Headrest have been influenced by and adopted elements of 1990s slacker rock into their sound.

Here are two songs that give a good impression of the typical slacker rock sound.

From Dinosaur's 1987 album You're Living All Over Me  
[Dinosaur Jr \- Just Like Heaven](https://youtu.be/UT7IpRx08tE) (more of a noise rock sound)

From Pavement's 1994 album Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain  
[Pavement \- Cut Your Hair (Official Video)](https://youtu.be/QTTgpTeb0Z8) (more of a poppy sound)
