Crust punk is a metallic form of Hardcore Punk that grew out of the Anarcho-Punk movement in the mid-1980s. The genre initially drew influence from Discharge, who fused the heavy Speed Metal sound of Mot√∂rhead with anarcho-punk's political messaging. Crust bands often evoke apocalyptic imagery, painting scenes of environmental destruction, post-industrial decay, war-torn landscapes, and a return to a primitive, nature-based way of life. Over time the dark sound and aesthetic of early Black Metal has had a growing impact on the genre.

Approaches to crust range widely. "Crustcore" bands like Doom and Anti-Cimex employ a relatively straightforward, raucous style closely related to D-Beat. Crust bands that incorporated Thrashcore into their sound, like Electro Hippies, were a key influence on Grindcore. On the other end of the spectrum, brooding, atmospheric Neocrust bands like His Hero Is Gone and Fall of Efrafa often use extended song structures, thick, sludgy guitars, and sometimes incorporate acoustic instrumentation to give the music an earthy, melancholy quality. A third notable approach to crust is that of the especially metallic Stenchcore bands like Hellbastard and Deviated Instinct, who have proved very influential in extreme metal.
