Jovem Guarda (Portuguese for "Young Guard") was a scene and cultural movement from the 1960s that influenced the Brazilian youth. It was based on a TV show with the same name and, comparable to Beatlemania's international impact, helped define a big part of Brazilian music, putting it in tune with the international Rock phenomenon of the time. As a music genre, it is a form of Beat Music, influenced by the 1950s Rock & Roll, Motown Sound and genres such as Merseybeat and Rockabilly. Most of the lyrics talk about love relationships and aspects of that time, some of which were adaptations of British and American rock songs \- hence its other name iê-iê-iê, Portuguese transcription of the "yeah, yeah yeah" line of The Beatles' "She Loves You" \-, and often being associated with the 'twist' dance. The movement started to fade around 1969 and was almost over a few months after the TV show was dissolved.
