While I'm not a massive fan of Jungle as a genre, here's my favourite Jungle album, Sumo Jungle GRANDEUR by 寺田創一 (Soichi Terada), from 1996\.

The usage of Japanese samples give the album a unique aesthetic among Jungle records. It's energetic and interesting, but chill and atmospheric as well. I found it thoroughly enjoyable; one of my favourite EDM albums from the 90s for sure.
