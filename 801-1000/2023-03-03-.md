Microtonal classical music is a movement in modern avant-garde music, in which composers focus heavily on the use of microtonal intervals (pitches not found in Western music's traditional twelve-note scale). Although the use of electronic instruments often makes microtonal music easier and more precise, acoustic compositions are possible and not infrequent.

Giacinto Francesco Maria Scelsi (1905-1988) was an Italian composer who also wrote surrealist poetry in French.

He is best known for having composed music based around only one pitch, altered in all manners through microtonal oscillations, harmonic allusions, and changes in timbre and dynamics, as paradigmatically exemplified in his Quattro pezzi su una nota sola ("Four Pieces on a single note", 1959). This composition remains his most famous work and one of the few performed to significant recognition during his lifetime.
