Xiu Xiu is an American experimental band, formed in 2002 by singer-songwriter Jamie Stewart in San Jose, California. Currently, the line-up consists of Stewart, Angela Seo, and David Kendrick, though the band has seen over 15 members since it's inception in 2002\. Their music can be described as Art Pop, Experimental Rock, Post-Industrial, Experimental, Synth Punk, and Spoken Word.

Here's their 2003 album A Promise.

This album sounds depressive, anxious, and lonely. It's sparse and atmospheric, strange, uncomfortable, and sometimes manic.

Here's a track from their 2016 album Plays the Music of Twin Peaks, which I really like.
