Darkstep is a hard, uptempo style of Drum and Bass that emerged in the late 1990s throughout Europe and the USA. It initially emerged from developments within Techstep and Neurofunk (see rec 409), building on a more sinister, claustrophobic atmosphere and using heavier breakbeats (with extensive use of compressed and chopped Amen breaks), chromatic scale melodies, wobbly Reese bass sounds and pounding, dissonant, Post-Industrial-style textures. Early proponents of the style such as Panacea and Technical Itch codified the characteristics of darkstep by using more distorted programmed or sampled rhythms in contrast to typical techstep (sometimes drawing inspiration from Breakcore) along with the typical sampling of Horror and Science Fiction movie samples, in conjunction with similarly themed aesthetics in song titles.

Here are a couple tracks off The Later After, a 2007 album by DJ hidden

[The Eight Veil (Remastered Version)](https://youtu.be/ugrX8e3UCNU)  (this one is much closer to Dark Ambient, including it because I like it)

Darkstep has seen multiple developments since the mid 2000s, which I'll talk about next.
