Punk Blues

Punk blues fuses the instrumentation and scales of Blues Rock with the rawness and attitude of Punk Rock, while not necessarily adhering to its traditional sound. The merge of Punkâ€™s rowdy energy with Blues can be traced back to the Proto-Punk and Garage Rock bands of the 1960s and 1970s, with artists such as Captain Beefheart, The Velvet Underground, The Stooges and The Modern Lovers all having experimented with pushing the kinetic boundaries of blues rock.

Punk blues first emerged as a genre in the early 1980s, split into two regional scenes. In the United States, the genre was more sonically akin to conventional punk rock, specifically Psychobilly (The Gun Club and The Cramps) and Garage Punk (The Gories and Pussy Galore). Meanwhile, in Australia, a band known as The Birthday Party took the concept of blues-tinged punk music in a more experimental Post-Punk fashion.

Through the mid-1980s and 1990s, under the Bad Seeds name, Cave explored elements of Country, Gospel, Piano Blues and Singer-Songwriter, all while pushing the limits of punk blues.
