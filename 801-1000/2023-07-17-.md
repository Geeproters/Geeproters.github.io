Slushwave

Slushwave is a subgenre of Vaporwave, which distinguishes itself by its strong reliance on heavy sample manipulation to deliver a hypnagogic, thick sound distinctive to the style. The genre specialises in creating softly looping Ambient-based soundscapes through repetitive sequencing of its sample material, emphasising dreamy atmospheres along with a characteristic “slushy” manipulation of sound, which is typically achieved through the multi-layering utilisation of effects such as reverbs, delays, flangers, filters and especially phasers (hence the less frequently used term phaserwave). The sample material itself is often sourced from, but not limited to, similar genre origins as vaporwave typically draws from, but with a heavier focus laid upon East Asian genres such as City Pop, C-Pop or J-Pop. Though slushwave primarily originated from purely sample-based compositions, in recent years artists have begun creating entirely original slushwave by sampling self-written material.

Thematically, slushwave mostly sets itself apart from most of the established aesthetics of vaporwave, such as consumerism, corporate clichés or 1980s and 1990s nostalgia, and instead predominantly tries to evoke ideas of love, longing, melancholy and dreams, which go along with the lush and ambient nature of the music. Releases are often presented with minimal artwork like untreated stills of old visual media, such as movies or commercials, and titled using non-Latin alphabets, further mystifying the listening experience.

Often, slushwave is confused for Dreampunk, due to their similar ideas of ambient-focused soundscapes under the broad umbrella of Vapor. However, dreampunk is defined by its use of Field Recordings and strong Progressive Electronic influences, and often puts much less of a focus on sampled material
