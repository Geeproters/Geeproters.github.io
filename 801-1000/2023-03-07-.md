Sequenza (Italian for "sequence") is the name borne by fourteen compositions for solo instruments or voice by Luciano Berio, composed over a period of longer than 20 years.  
Here's the full playlist: [Sequenza I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvPPNkzo5W8&list=OLAK5uy_kpn89TYlB4Dq-qTuqex-t13oy8PGumx4o)

This is a really neat collection of works. Each piece could be thought of as demonstrating a range of the possibilities and sounds produceable from the instrument.

It's also good fun if you want to test your knowledge of orchestral instruments. See how fast you can get each sequence.

The pieces, some of which call for extended techniques, are:

	Sequenza I (1958; rev. 1992\) for flute  
	Sequenza II (1963) for harp  
	Sequenza III (1965) for female voice  
	Sequenza IV (1965) for piano  
	Sequenza V (1966) for trombone  
	Sequenza VI (1967) for viola  
	Sequenza VII (1969/2000) for oboe (reworked as Sequenza VIIb for soprano saxophone in 2000\)  
	Sequenza VIII (1976) for violin  
	Sequenza IX (1980) for clarinet (reworked 1981 as Sequenza IXb for alto saxophone, and 1980 as Sequenza IXc for bass clarinet)  
	Sequenza X (1984) for trumpet and piano resonance  
	Sequenza XI (1987) for guitar  
	Sequenza XII (1995) for bassoon  
	Sequenza XIII (1995) for accordion  
	Sequenza XIV (2002) for cello (reworked in 2004 by Stefano Scodanibbio as Sequenza XIVb for double bass)
