Salsa romántica is a sub-genre of Salsa music that emerged in the mid 1980s and arose to commercial success in Puerto Rico, Hispanic communities in the USA and most parts of Latin America during the 1990s. Its compositions follow strong Pop overtones and are generally shorter than classic salsa music, making it ideal for commercial radio. Lyrics often relate love stories or contain implicit / explicit eroticism.

Lalo Rodríguez and Frankie Ruiz were among the early pioneers of this style. It is also not uncommon for some salsa romántica artists to indulge in certain forms of Latin Pop (as well as Canción melódica), such as the case of internationally famed singers like Marc Anthony.

From Grupo Niche's 1990 album Cielo de tambores.

I'm not sure what it is about it, but this album makes me feel really nostalgic for some reason.
