I seem to be in the habit of revisiting Ryuichi Sakamoto about once per year. Since the last time was rec 632, here are a couple tracks off of another of his albums.

1996 is a 1996 album by Japanese composer and pianist Ryuichi Sakamoto. It contains a selection of Sakamoto's most popular compositions plus two new compositions, all arranged for a standard piano trio, piano, violin, and cello.

Most of the tracks could be considered Modern Classical and Chamber Music.

Nothing as bold or pioneering as his electronic albums, but full of beautiful, nostalgic, relaxing music.
