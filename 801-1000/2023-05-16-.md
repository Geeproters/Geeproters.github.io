98.12.28 男達の別れ (98.12.28 Otokotachi no Wakare) is a live album recorded in 1998 and released the year after. I've talked about the band behind it, Fishmans, a number of times now. They were and are a very unique band, both in their sound and reception, having become immensely popular in online communities, such as Rate Your Music, but much less well known by professional critics. On RYM, the album is ranked \#39 overall, \#1 for live

This performance was originally planned as a goodbye for the bassist, but served as a swan song to the whole band itself, as Shinji Sato, the lead singer and guitarist, would die a couple of months later. This is the apex of the band's career, juxtaposing their pop talent with their willingness to experiment.

It's repetitive and psychedelic, and thus definitely not for everyone. For enjoyers of the genre, however, it's practically indispensable. I'm a big fan of it myself, but only when I'm in a relaxed mood.

Here's the full album, with a runtime of just over 2 hours and 10 minutes

The live version of Long Season (studio version on rec 228), starting at roughly 1:31:00 as the last track of the album is a perfect final track that really feels like the end of a journey.
