From Wikipedia:  
Deltron 3030 is the 2000 debut album by hip hop supergroup Deltron 3030\. It is a rap opera concept album set in a dystopian year 3030 that tells of the dualistic conflict of fatalism that takes place between the moral concepts of "righteousness" and "malevolence." The story tells a prophetic tale of a warrior's thirst for battle as Del's alter ego, who goes by the name "Deltron-Zero," along with his comrade who happens to be a time-travelling cyborg wizard named "the Automator," as they face-off against megalithic corporations that megalomaniacally rule over our thermodynamic universe. The lyrics were written in less than two weeks and are characterised by extravagant allusions to futuristic outer-space themes in the tradition of Afrofuturist works by Sun Ra and George Clinton. Many samples originated with the contemporary French classical composer William Sheller.

Futuristic, atmospheric production from  Dan the Automator. Great work from DJ Kid Koala as a scratch DJ, too.
