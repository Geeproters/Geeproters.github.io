Elizabeth Woolridge Grant, known professionally as Lana Del Rey, is an American singer-songwriter. Her music is noted for its cinematic quality and exploration of tragic romance, glamour, and melancholia, with frequent references to contemporary pop culture and 1950sâ€“1960s Americana.

Her 2018 single Venice Bitch has been considered by many to be a career high. On RYM it's ranked \#2 for 2018, \#268 overall for singles.

A good track for people interested in Dream/Art/Progressive Pop with a Neo-Psychedelia feel, but her style also definitely isn't for everyone. Interesting textures for the most part. Lana's singing style which involves very little lip movement but emphatic vowel enunciatiation works with the ethereal feeling of the rest of the song.
