Lullabies are a type of soothing song, with or without accompaniment, generally performed to help young children sleep.

Michael Armstrong is an English musician who has produced a series of cover albums in the style of lullabies, known as the Rockabye Baby\! Lullaby Renditions. The artists and groups he's covered include Queen, The Cure, Led Zeppelin, Metallica, Bjork, The Beatles, Nirvana, Weezer, Pearl Jam, The Smashing Pumpkins, Kanye West, and many others.

I'm not entirely sure, but I think his main audience is probably parents who want lullabies they can enjoy while listening with their children. I just thought it was somewhat interesting.

Here are a couple tracks from Rockabye Baby\! Lullaby Renditions of Radiohead, released 2006\.

Honestly done very well. Quite subtle. It's interesting that the videos have so many dislikes lol
