Developing as a mixture of Darkstep with Hardcore \[EDM\], crossbreed was born out of the equal influence of both genres towards the late 2000s. While most of the genre's pioneers were from the Netherlands, it quickly spread to other locations in adjacent European scenes and eventually to the US as well. It is characterised by powerful, harsh 4/4 rhythms mixed with high-speed, Amen-derived breaks, Drum and Bass drum programming, and gloomy, claustrophobic, and horror-related textures and atmospheres of darkstep. Certain producers have additionally introduced influences of Breakcore and Post-Industrial music, particularly Industrial Hardcore.

The name "crossbreed" was first introduced through a series of releases on the Genosha One Seven Five label, which was titled "Crossbreed Definition Series". All three parts of the series featured the pioneering duo The Outside Agency collaborating with various artists. DJ Hidden and Eye-D, the founders of the label, were also some of the first to produce the genre.
