Hypnagogic Drift

Hypnagogic Drift is an earlier style or technique of Vaporwave focused on creating and exploring droning, dream-like atmospheres through distorted samples looped smoothly so as to "drift" in and out. Though it is technically similar to Broken Transmission (see rec 542), it is distinct in that its sample loops tend to be smooth and uninterrupted and its songs are often much longer so as to create a sense of getting lost in an infinite dreamscape. The style also shares many commonalities and overlap with Slushwave, with the signature phasers of the genre adding to the dreamy hypnagogic quality of the sample loops; some see Hypnagogic Drift as the parent genre from which Slushwave was born. Most releases considered Hypnagogic Drift, including its most important/genre-defining albums, are best described as a combination of styles including Slushwave, Drone, Progressive Electronic, Utopian Virtual, and more.

The genre was pioneered by éª· \[Skeleton\]. His 2010 album Holograms (rec 944\) is considered the start of the style or at the very least its centrepiece

Here's a single from Daniel Lopatin (aka Chuck Person, Oneohtrix Point Never (see rec 384)) undeniably utilising the same principles as Hypnagogic Drift with its eerie vocal sample gently pulsing in and out by way of extreme reverb over a smooth and equally repetitive backing instrumental. If you only listened for a brief few seconds you would assume you just heard part of some regular radio music, until the repetition slowly becomes the main point of focus, a common intention of the style.
