Novelty Piano

Novelty Piano (or Novelty Ragtime) was a form of piano music popular in the 1920s. A result of Ragtime being overtaken by Jazz in mainstream American appeal, Novelty Piano sought to apply new technology to the former genre and therefore produce a more elaborate, performance-oriented style of rag. The style could be described as a more elaborate, virtuosic version of ragtime.

One of the most notable Novelty Piano composers was Zez Confrey, whose 1921 release “Kitten on the Keys” helped popularise the genre.
