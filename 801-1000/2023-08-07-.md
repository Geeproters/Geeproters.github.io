Here's a vaguely similar album, (East Coast Hip-hop though, not West Coast, among other differences) The Cold Vein by Cannibal Ox, released 2001\.

There's lots to say about Vast Aire and Vordul Mega's debut album, which was produced by El-P. The lyricism is cold and dark, painting a gritty image of New York hood-life with a lot of abstract influence and references to science and science fiction.

El-P's production is detailed and mechanical, lush, and futuristic. Vast Aire's delivery is vivid and poetic, and Vordul Mega's flow is rapid and hard-hitting.

The Cold Vein was well received by critics, drawing many favourable comparisons to the 36 Chambers-era Wu-Tang Clan.
