VHS Pop (current definition)

The current definition of VHS Pop is somewhat different from the old definition of the previous rec. VHS Pop is a subgenre of Vaporwave with a diverse array of influences and aesthetics. In its most recent form, it is seen as an intersection of Vaporwave and Instrumental Hip Hop, with early releases such as ICE IN THA VEINS solidifying this connection. Inclusion of tape hiss, hip hop percussion, and R\&B samples are common tropes within VHS Pop.

Here's Epson and Channel Select's split 2018 album Saw U Last Nite  
[EPSON / channel select \- SAW U LAST NITE](https://youtu.be/X8lMh86Bx_c)

EPSON's side is super smooth and soothing. channel select's side is more crunchy, hard-hitting, and danceable. Very listenable album.
