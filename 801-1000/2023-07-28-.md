Parody/Satirical/Vapormeme

Vaporwave is no stranger to parody or ridicule, both good-spirited and ill-intentioned. Releases in this genre either satirise common elements in vaporwave (visually or sonically), are conceptually laughable, or just intend to be bizarre altogether.

Here's a track from Blank Goofee 0's 2015 album Blank Goofee  
[Blank Goofee \- Goofy Zones](https://youtu.be/sCucd0N33oU)  
Basically, Blank Banshee (see rec 318 for the album referenced, vaportrap) but sampling Disney's Goofy character.

Here's Vaporwave Fantasies' 2014 album Eccojams Vol. 1 (Nightcore)  
[Vaporwave Fantasies \- Eccojams Vol. 1 (Nightcore) (2014)](https://youtu.be/B3ySj3AagaI)  
Vaporwave meets nightcore, another internet-based genre centered around sped-up trance/Eurodance with an affinity for anime. This album is what you get when you take the original Chuck Person's Eccojams Vol. 1 (see rec 941\) and give it the nightcore treatment? Basically move it back to normal speed, and slightly pitch it up.

Here's a track from ░▒▓【ALL CAPS AND Alt Key Codes™】░▒▓'s ひどく翻訳日本語の文字 ("Japanese characters translated badly")  
[Vaporwave? More like gayporwave](https://youtu.be/dj3GK5tz_pM)  
This album parodies a number of vaporwave subgenres. This track is kinda fire.
