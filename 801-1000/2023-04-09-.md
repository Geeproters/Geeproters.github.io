Stratosphere is a 1998 album by Duster. It is the most well-known slowcore and slacker-rock album by a significant margin, and is commonly considered the best of both sister genres (ranked \#5 for 1998 on RYM, \#190 overall).

While I'm not a huge fan, I can understand the wide reknown the album has garnered. It's a relaxing listen with digestible song lengths and intricate songwriting. More than that, its vibe and consistency perfectly represent the union of slacker rock and slowcore. The music matches the cover better than most albums, which also deserves praise.
