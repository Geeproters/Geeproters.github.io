Plena is a genre of music and dance native to Puerto Rico. The plena genre originated in Barrio San Antón, Ponce, Puerto Rico, around 1900\.

The plena was a result of the mixing of the culturally diverse popular class, where their workplace, neighborhood, and life experiences met to create an expressive, satirical style of music. It became a way for the working class to gain empowerment through parody. Due to originating in the lower social class, it was regarded by the upper class as "a menace to public order and private property" and was for many years associated with people of la vida alegre (the merry life), referring to prostitutes, dancers, alcoholics, and 'moral degenerates'. Singing and dancing of the plena often happened in cafetines, bars that frequently doubled as brothels and where interracial socializing and sexual encounters were free to take place.

Plena music is generally folkloric in nature, but with song lyrics that relate to current events.
