Dance Punk

As mentioned on 901, New Wave emerged simultaneously with Post-Punk, and It's one of the ones I've already covered (682). Closely related is Dance Punk, which originated in the late 1970s. Dance punk is a Post-Punk style characterised by mixing the energy of Punk Rock with the danceable rhythms of Funk and Disco. It was mainly prominent in New York City's Punk movement, and many dance-punk artists, including Lizzy Mercier Descloux and Liquid Liquid, had close associations with the concurrent No Wave and Mutant Disco scenes. A separate but smaller scene also originated from the United Kingdom's post-punk scene.

Gang of Four's band name was named after the Maoist political faction I mentioned on rec 581\.
