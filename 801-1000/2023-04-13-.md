Cosmogramma is a 2010 IDM, Glitch Hop, Wonky (Off-kilter fusion of Dubstep and Hip Hop) album by Flying Lotus.

Really entertaining album to listen through. Amazing samples and production create a choatic and dense, retro-futuristic, surreal, and almost otherworldly feel. I'm always a sucker for music that combines electronic and acoustic elements in creative ways, and this does it great.

[Do the Astral Plane](https://youtu.be/V_VeIP_l7iA) (My favourite off the album)

Here's just those strings on Do The Astral Plane because it's kind of neat to hear on its own. The part at 1:54 goes hard.
