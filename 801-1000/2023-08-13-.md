Psychedelic Soul

Psychedelic soul came about when Sly & The Family Stone took the effects heard in Psychedelic Rock and brought them into Soul. Psychedelic soul often uses keyboards and electric guitars to create a psychedelic sound accompanying soul vocals. Psychedelic soul is closely related to the Funk of the late 1960s and early 1970s (psychedelic soul's heyday), as many musical acts played music incorporating both styles, such as Stevie Wonder or The Temptations.
