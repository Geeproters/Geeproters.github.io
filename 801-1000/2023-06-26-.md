Psychobilly

Psychobilly music is the cross-pollination of Punk Rock and Rockabilly. Inspiration for the style can be traced to U.S. acts The Cramps and Screamin' Jay Hawkins, though the first fully accredited Psychobilly band is generally considered to be The Meteors, who formed in the U.K. of the early 80s. It combines the energy and rhythm of Rockabilly tradition, the outsider world-view and confrontational nature of the Punk aesthetic, and a good dose of lurid observation and humor. Though past its heyday, Psychobilly maintains a vital underground scene internationally.
