Here's another Salsa Dura album, Eddie Palmieri's 1975 album "Unfinished Masterpiece"  
[EDDIE PALMIERI: Unfinished Masterpiece.](https://youtu.be/dvbji9bgN4U)

Eddie Palmieri is an American Grammy Award-winning pianist, bandleader, musician, and composer of Puerto Rican ancestry. He is the founder of the bands La Perfecta, La Perfecta II, and Harlem River Drive.

This album also belongs to the genre of Descarga, a Cuban genre, pioneered by Cachao in the 1950s, consisting of improvised jam sessions incorporating elements of Jazz and Afro-Cuban music.

I like both the previous two albums a lot.
