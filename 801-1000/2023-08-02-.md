A Tribute to Joni Mitchell is a 2007 musical tribute to Joni Mitchell featuring Sufjan Stevens, Bj√∂rk, Caetano Veloso, Brad Mehldau, Cassandra Wilson, Prince, Sarah McLachlan, Annie Lennox, Emmylou Harris, Elvis Costello, k.d. lang, and James Taylor.

The original creativity and genius of Joni Mitchell is hard to replicate and hasn't very well carried over to the majority of these covers. That said, Sufjan Steven's (see rec 394\) and Bjork's (see rec 594\) are the two tracks most worth listening imo. Here they are with the originals, for comparison.

I recced a song by her on rec 709, but since I haven't described her before, Kathryn Dawn Lang OC AOE (born November 2, 1961), known by their stage name k.d. lang, is a Canadian pop and country singer-songwriter and occasional actress. Lang has won Juno Awards and Grammy Awards for her musical performances. Hits include the songs "Constant Craving" and "Miss Chatelaine".
