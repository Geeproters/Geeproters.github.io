Queercore

Queercore is more of a movement of LGBT scenes within Punk Rock than a genre, mainly distinguished for its lyrical content expressing the viewpoints of the LGBTQ+ community, as well as promoting queer pride and unity.

The roots of the movement can be traced back to the mid-1980s. In 1985, the original term for the scene, "homocore" (which was later changed to "queercore" to be more diverse and inclusive). Lyrically, queercore admonishes the homophobia and transphobia of both the hardcore punk scene and society at large. Much like Riot Grrrl, queercore is highly critical of modern concepts of gender roles as well as the exclusive attitudes within the gay community.

Although queercore is considered more of a scene than a genre, there is still emphasis on the music, which is a specific offshoot of punk rock. However, it is not limited strictly to punk influences, having borrowed elements from genres such as Industrial Music, Indie Rock, No Wave, and Experimental Rock. Representative bands from the genre include Team Dresch, God Is My Co-Pilot, and Tribe 8\.

I don't like this one nearly as much as Team Dresch's Captain My Captain from last rec, but it's also somewhat interesting if you can get past the potentially annoying vocal style.
