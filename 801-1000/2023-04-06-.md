Here are 3 tracks from 3 earlier slowcore albums. These albums contributed to the genre becoming an indie rock staple in the early 1990s.

From Red House Painters \[Rollercoaster\] by Red House Painters (1993)

From I Could Live in Hope by Low (1994)  
[Lullaby](https://youtu.be/zEmtfA8FETc)

Down Colorful Hill by Red House Painters (1992)  
[Medicine Bottle](https://youtu.be/i8Ubpz40MDE)

These songs exhibit the main traits of slowcore very clearly, and is melancholic, depressive, lonely, introspective, lethargic, and mellow. Slowcore is easy to listen to because despite the music's hopelessness or gloominess, it has a tranquility about it that makes it peaceful and ethereal.
