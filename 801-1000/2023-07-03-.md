Emo

Emo originated in Washington, D.C., in the summer of 1985, initially coined as Emocore and was used to describe a group of hardcore punk bands that slowed their music down and used more personal, poetic lyrics with melodic singing in response to increasing violence and reactionary sentiments in the scene.

In Maryland, The Hated & Moss Icon began implementing Post-Punk & Alternative Rock influences, inspiring groups such as Don Martin Three & Indian Summer in the following years, leading to a more dynamic, melodic, and progressive sound. This new movement became known as emo, removing the '-core' suffix as it progressed away from hardcore, characterised by dynamic song structures, longer song lengths, a juxtaposition of soft and screamed vocals, and distorted, arpeggiated & frequently octave chord-focused guitar parts. Alongside this, bands began to take influence from Indie Rock, retaining the core aesthetics of emo, but coming to a less aggressive, more melodic sound.

As Midwest emo became the dominant style, acts such as The Get Up Kids & The Promise Ring increased the pop sensibilities of the genre, leading to the emergence of Emo-Pop. These bands would achieve unprecedented popularity, paving the way for the mainstream success of Fall Out Boy & My Chemical Romance in the following decade. In reaction to this success, a scene formed at the turn of the 2000s and 2010s, labeled 'emo revival,' with bands such as Algernon Cadwallader, Snowing, and later Modern Baseball & Marietta spearheading the movement.
