Orchestra Baobab is a Senegalese band established in 1970 as the house band of the Baobab Club in Dakar. Many of the band's original members had previously played with Star Band de Dakar in the 1960s.

Here's a song from their 2017 album Tribute to Ndiouga Dieng

Uplifting and rhythmic. The rest of the album is good too.

It belongs to the genre of Wolof. The music of the Wolof people of Senegal and The Gambia comprises a wide variety of West African Music traditions influenced by nearby cultures, especially the Serer, Fula and Jola. The earliest Wolof traditions, dating back to Medieval times, were developed by griots in a ceremonial context. Praise songs known as tagg are probably the oldest forms of Wolof music and oral literature, having influenced more modern vocal styles such as the Islamic Nasheed. Wolof drumming traditions, which are polyrhythmic and complex, are also thought to have evolved centuries ago.

Typical Wolof instrumentation includes the xalam (5-string plucked lute), the riti (bowed lute of Fula origin), sabar drums (of Serer origin), the tama (talking drum), as well as various aerophones. In contemporary Wolof music, instruments imported from Western traditions, such as the acoustic and the electric guitar, the trap set, and drum machines, are also present.
