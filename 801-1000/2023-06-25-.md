Cowpunk

Cowpunk, or country punk, is a type of Punk music that mixes together Country, Rockabilly, and Contemporary Folk music with the familiar punk sound. The genre has its roots in the late 1970s in the United Kingdom with bands like Mekons, and gained momentum in the 1980s, especially in Los Angeles, with bands such as The Beat Farmers, The Blasters, Green on Red, and X (who, although not cowpunk, have influenced the sound with their rockabilly and country mix of punk rock).

Famous artists in the genre include Meat Puppets, Jason & The Scorchers, Rank and File and Hank Williams, III.
