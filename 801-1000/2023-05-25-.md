Spirituals, a predecessor to Gospel, began as unaccompanied singing by American slaves and share some of the characteristics of Work Songs. Although the words always had Christian content, there was often a subtext that could not be understood by the slave owners, including references to the underground railroad. Many of the themes of freedom from suffering were revived during the American civil rights movement.

One of the earliest groups to gain national recognition performing spirituals after the American Civil War was Fisk Jubilee Singers. Some notable mid-20th century artists who are known for recording spirituals include Paul Robeson and Mahalia Jackson, though neither exclusively performed spirituals. Marian Anderson, one of the first African American Opera stars, also recorded spirituals. While many spirituals have their primary roots in African American culture, some well known spirituals, such as "Amazing Grace", are adaptations of Hymns brought to the US by white settlers.

Here are a couple tracks that I found on a compilation album, released 1959 Angola Prison Spirituals.
