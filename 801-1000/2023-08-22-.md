Synth punk (Aka Electropunk) appropriates the harsh elements of Punk Rock but replaces the predominance of guitars with synthesisers and drum machines. The genre can be traced back to bands such as Suicide and The Screamers and borrows elements from Krautrock, No Wave and the experimental tradition. Synth punk differs from music that may be termed Dance-Punk in that it is often dissonant and lo-fi, rather than the more upbeat, dance-floor ready feel of dance-punk.
