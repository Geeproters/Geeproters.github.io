Stride

Stride is another style of piano music that evolved from Ragtime, introducing more sophisticated harmonics and a beat that preceded Swing. Often faster and more complex than ragtime, stride piano can also be seen as one of the most popular early forms of Jazz, developing its style later on to include improvisation, blue notes, and later, more advanced swing rhythms. James P. Johnson is known as the “Father of Stride Piano”.

The style was further developed by Art Tatum, who appears alone on the last 5 tracks of this album.
