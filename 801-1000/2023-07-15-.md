Bob Dylan is an American singer-songwriter. Generally regarded as one of the greatest songwriters ever, Dylan has been a major figure in popular culture over his 60 year career. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s, when songs such as "Blowin' in the Wind" (1963) and "The Times They Are a-Changin'" (1964) became anthems for the civil rights and antiwar movements. His lyrics during this period incorporated political, social, philosophical, and literary influences, defying pop music conventions and appealing to the burgeoning counterculture.

Here are two of his best-known songs, from his 1966 album The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan

I've now talked about a number of Vapor/Vaporwave subgenres and derivative genres including:  
Vaporwave (recs 23, 71, 153, 371, 628, 629, 824, includes album influenced)  
Hardvapour (rec 91\)  
Vaportrap (rec 318\)  
Hexd (rec 540\)  
Signalwave (rec 542\)  
Mallsoft (rec 547\)  
Dreampunk (rec 564\)  
Utopian Virtual (rec 571\)

Despite that, I've never outright described either, so I'll do that now, followed by a series of other Vapor genres and music.
