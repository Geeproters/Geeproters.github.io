Himiko Kikuchi is a Japanese jazz keyboardist, composer and arranger Himiko Kikuchi's 1987 album Flying Beagle. It belongs to the genres of Jazz Fusion, Jazz-Funk, City Pop, Samba-jazz, Big Band, and Smooth Jazz. Japanese JAzz Fusion is one of my favourite genres, hence rec 799, 632, 305, 220, and others.

This album has everything I look for in J-Jazz Fusion. Warm, lush, and at times chaotic. Above all, it's upbeat and uplifting. While it doesn't necessarily do anything unconventional, it doesn't really need to.

None of the instruments here are slacking off, but Kikuchi's piano and keyboard are definitely the highlights. If you enjoyed Hiromi Uehara's playing on rec 799, Himiko Kikuchi's playing will also be for you.
