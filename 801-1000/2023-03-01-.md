Boogie-Woogie

Honky-tonk music was an important influence on the boogie-woogie piano style.

Boogie woogie is one of the first Blues styles that appeared in the end of the 19th century. It was performed under different names and most likely appeared in the 1870s in camps of Afro-American workers at Marshall County and Harrison County in Texas, then through the big industrial cities' barrel houses.

Boogie woogie is played by piano (solo or as the main instrument). The musical structure consists of a repetitive eight note bass line played ostinato by left hand (eight-to-the-bar) while the right hand plays soloing and improvising blues harmonic lines. The tempo is usually faster than other traditional blues styles.

Boogie woogie was well popular during the 1930s and 1940s and became popular worldwide during 1940s. It is associated with the eponymous dance possessing lyrics dealing with instructions to dancers
