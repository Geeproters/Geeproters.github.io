Samba-choro is a musical genre that emerged in the 1930s resulting from the fusion of rhythmic elements and combining Samba with Choro.

A couple tracks from Cartola's self-titled 1976 Samba-choro album

It's already a lot, but here's a little more choro stuff for getting into the genre.

Tons e semitons by Paulinho Nogueira

Paulingo Nogueura and his protege, Toquinho, released my favourite choro album, simply titled Toquinho & Paulinho Nogueira, in 1999 (see rec 254).

Altamiro Carrilho was a Brazilian musician and composer. He is widely regarded as a master flutist and a major representative of the choro genre. I mentioned one of his maxixe works on rec 854\. Here's a collection of choro works he played.

The Japanese choro scene, bands like ko-ko-ya and Choro Club (recs 296, 463), are what actually got me into choro music. Choro Club's Soundtracks for Aria the Animation remain some of my favourite soundtracks for any media.
