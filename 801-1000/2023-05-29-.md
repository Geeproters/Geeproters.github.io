Country gospel is a Traditional Country style that heavily incorporates Gospel music.

During the era of 'hillbilly music' (the term country music was usually known by from the mid-1920s to the 1950s), gospel songs were usually part of the performer's heritage and roots. The Carter Family spearheaded the overt fusion of the two genres, recording songs from 1927 onwards, though country gospel presumably predates this. Close Harmony duos such as The Louvin Brothers and The Blue Sky Boys started to perform and record country gospel material alongside secular songs, the former using 'fire and brimstone' themes depicting God's wrath. A specific subset of country gospel fusing Bluegrass and gospel (Bluegrass Gospel) emerged alongside the rise of bluegrass in the 1940s and was practised by giants of the genre such as The Stanley Brothers and Bill Monroe.
