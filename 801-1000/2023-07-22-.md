Since I've already talked about Vektroid like 4 times, why not a 5th.

Here's a release under her alias Tanning Salon, Dream Castle, from 2011\.

As should be clear by now, Vektroid has pioneered several Vapor sub and microgenres. I don't know if this microgenre has a name (maybe something like retro-medievalism or cathedralhaze would work), but the general idea is an infusion of medieval or medieval fantasy soundscapes with vaporwave production, and a combination of both aesthetics. This particular album has a less video-gamey feel than a lot of electronic fantasy inspired genres (a la dungeon synth), and instead more of a dark, dusty, remorseful atmosphere, with ambient and drone elements.

The ambient stretches of drone on this album are punctuated with low static, pops and other artefacts from what appears to be a really damaged magnetic tape. I'm curious how she got that effect, I assume she used analog tapes.

Some tracks use more medieval instrumentation (eg. the organ in Dunadd Hill), while others sound more modern in instrumentation (eg. Camelot Wanderers with its piano)

This is probably my favourite Vektroid release, as it feels particularly unique to me but still works great.
