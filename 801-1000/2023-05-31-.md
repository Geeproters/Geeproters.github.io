Gothic Rock is a style of rock-based music focusing primarily on 'gothic' music and imagery. Typical aspects of the sound include synths, moderate-to-heavy employment of chorus and echo effects and "twangy" rhythm guitar. It developed in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s and early 1980s as an offshoot of Post-Punk, and was initially applied to artists such as Bauhaus, Siouxsie and the Banshees and The Cure, who had begun to introduce darker elements into the sound.

Disintegration, the 1989 album by The Cure, is considered to be the quintessential gothic rock album.On RYM it happens to be ranked \#1 for 1989, \#22 overall

In the early '80s by, a lighter, more 'ethereal' style known as Ethereal Wave (see recs 592, 593), focusing on atmospheric guitar soundscapes, was pioneered by Cocteau Twins in the UK, as an offshoot of Gothic Rock. YOu may be able to hear the roots of that genre in this.
