Timothy Charles Buckley III (February 14, 1947 â€“ June 29, 1975\) was an American musician. His music and style changed considerably through the years. Buckley began his career based in folk music, but his subsequent albums experimented with jazz, psychedelia, funk, soul, the avant-garde, and an evolving voice-as-instrument sound. He died at the age of 28 from a heroin and morphine overdose, leaving behind sons Taylor and Jeff.

Works in Progress is a compilation album by Tim Buckley. The album is a collection of studio recordings dating from early and mid-1968 in addition to one recording dating from a recording session in 1967\. It has only little of his later experimentation, and none of the overinstrumentation that plagued his earlier work; but it has the chamber-like atmosphere of his middle period.
