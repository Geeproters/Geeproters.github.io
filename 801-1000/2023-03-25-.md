Nick Drake's 1972 Contemporary Folk / Singer-Songwriter album Pink Moon  
[Nick Drake \- Pink Moon (Full Album 1972\)](https://youtu.be/Nvx20hrqNB4)

A minimalistic album primarily using only Nick's voice and acoustic guitars.

This was Nick's 3rd and final album before his early passing at 26 years old from an overdose of a prescribed antidepressant. Drake did not find a wide audience during his lifetime, but his work gradually achieved wider notice and recognition afterwards.

The lyrics and music of Pink Moon lend to an aimless or meditative feeling, but remain philosophical and poetic.

On RYM this album is ranked \#2 for 1972, \#31 overall
