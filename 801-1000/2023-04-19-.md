To See the Next Part of the Dream by 파란노을 \[Parannoul\], who started putting out music in the 2020's and has experienced quite the burst of popularity. This album was released 2021, and belongs to the genres of Shoegaze, Emo, and Noise Pop

Emo in particular isn't for everyone, so I think this is probably the least accessible of the last 5 albums mentioned. I'm not a huge fan of it generally, but sometimes you want that noisy wash of sound to drown out everything else.

The album on 850 is my favourite among these albums.

There's a whole bunch of popular Brazilian genres I have (and haven't) briefly mentioned, but never talked about in detail, so I'll be doing the next long series of related genres on popular Brazilian music, focusing on the last century with a couple from before that. This series is likely to be even longer than that of the Western Classical music tradition from rec 770 to 792, even if I cut out the genres I don't think are relatively less worth mentioning.
