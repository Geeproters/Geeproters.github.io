Religion has been a predominant subject matter in Bluegrass music since its inception, and continues to be a major theme to the present day. Bluegrass Gospel explores the same topics as Country Gospel, utilising bluegrass instrumentation and vocals. Christian lyrics, intricate, fast tempos, expressive three and four part harmony vocals and the occasional A cappella chorus are popular distinguishing features of the genre. Significant practitioners include traditional artists like Bill Monroe, The Stanley Brothers and The Louvin Brothers, as well as modern artists like The Isaacs, IIIrd Tyme Out and Ricky Skaggs.
