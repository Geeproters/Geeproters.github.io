Here're a couple tracks from a nice Korean Indie Rock album, Dreamtalk by 3호선 버터플라이 \[3rd Line Butterfly\], released 2012\.

[너와나 You and Me](https://youtu.be/cKFGCsUIzFI)  
[헤어지는 날 바로 오늘 Today, The Day of Separation](https://youtu.be/DlQvaV2B7VI)

It's a fun album with an interesting mix of quiet, dreamy tracks like 쿠쿠루쿠쿠 비둘기 \[Cucurrucucú Paloma\], and louder tracks like 다시 가보니 흔적도 없네 \[Nothing There\]

Actually there's a bit of Korean indie rock I've been meaning to get through for a while, so I'll do that now.
