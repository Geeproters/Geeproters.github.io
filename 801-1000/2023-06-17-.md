Thrashcore

Thrashcore is a more extreme subgenre of Hardcore Punk distinguished by even faster tempos, briefer song structures, and the occasional use of blast beats. The genre is often seen as a predecessor and influence on the Grindcore and Powerviolence genres. What differentiates thrashcore from these genres is grindcore emerged out of the British Crust Punk scene and incorporates growled vocals, a greater use of dissonance, as well as extreme Metal elements, while powerviolence employs odd time signatures, jarring tempo changes, and incorporates elements of Noise Rock.

The "thrash" in thrashcore is derived from an obsolete term for what is now commonly known as hardcore punk. Thrashcore shares elements with but should not be confused with Crossover Thrash, which is a fusion of hardcore punk and Thrash Metal and is distinguished by a greater use of guitar solos and metal riffing, as well as a general use of longer, more varied compositions. Adding to this confusion is the fact that D.R.I., one of the pioneering thrashcore bands, later released albums in and became heavily associated with the crossover thrash genre.
