Southern Gospel is a style of Gospel music established in the early 1900s in the southern states of the United States of America. Initially sung A cappella by a Vocal Group quartet, sometimes with a pianist or guitar as accompaniment, with lyrics and messages primarily revolving around the teachings found within Christianity. Southern gospel grew out of the Churches of the southern states, with the name being created to differentiate from its sister genre, Traditional Black Gospel.

The Stamps Quartet and The King's Heralds were among the first groups to emerge from the genre, as well as family groups such as The Speer Family, Chuck Wagon Gang and The Happy Goodman Family. Southern gospel is a major influence on other gospel genres such as Bluegrass Gospel, Country Gospel and CCM, and over time new groups emerged that incorporated these sounds into their music. Among the most popular of these groups were The Cathedral Quartet, The Oak Ridge Boys and The Imperials.
