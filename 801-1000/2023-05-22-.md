Chicago soul. Like Southern Soul (Stax Records, Muscle Shoals Sound Records) and the classic Motown Sound, Chicago soul had its very own approach, style and impact on Soul music as a whole. Chicago soul actually was a unique combination of the hard, groove-oriented rhythm of southern soul and the sophisticated gloss of Motown arrangements and orchestration. Record labels such as Vee-Jay, OKeh, Chess, Brunswick, Dakar and Curtom were and are still regarded as chief purveyors of Chicago soul and people such as Curtis Mayfield, Jerry Butler, Jackie Wilson, Tyrone Davis, The Impressions and Gene Chandler were considered its chief artists. Goldmine writer Robert Pruter wrote a tome on Chicago soul in 1992 to demonstrate its exclusive character.

Here's a song by Curtis Mayfield, from his 1970 album Curtis.

Since it's almost 9 minutes, I'll leave it to just this for this rec, but the rest of the album is really great too. Chicago Soul is quite a rich and diverse genre.
