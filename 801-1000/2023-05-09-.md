Partido alto originated from the early roots of Samba primarily in Rio de Janeiro, in the beginning of the 20th century, starting as more danceable style than the original samba, with little or no vocals. The style also had influence from others local genres from Rio emerging at the same time, like Polka, Maxixe, lundu and others.

The earliest partido alto release I could find, Banda da Casa Faulhaber's Em casa da bahiana from 1911\.

In the mid-1950s, the genre was revived by some great composers of traditional Brazilian Music, such as Braguinha, Dorival Caymmi and Lúcio Alves, but this time it was less dance-oriented; instead, it's more focused on free vocals improvisations, with some backing vocals.

From Beth Carvalho's 1978 album De pé no chão.
