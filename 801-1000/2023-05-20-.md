Deep soul emerged in the USA in the mid-1960s, usually drawing on the typical Southern Soul groove and accentuating the Gospel and Blues influence, particularly Chicago Blues. It is played at a relatively slow tempo and is primarily focused on the intense, intimate lead vocal delivery, emphasising both the melancholic tone and lyrics, and producing a downbeat, reflective atmosphere. Common instrumental tropes include murky, 'scratchy' guitar sounds, prominent horn sections (accompanying strings more popular in 1970s recordings) and crystalline, spiritual-sounding piano and organ parts. The style declined in popularity in the late 1970s with the emergence of Disco and newer R\&B genres.

The term was coined by Dave Godin, who compiled his own Dave Godin's Deep Soul Treasures series. Notable artists include James Carr, Otis Redding, Percy Sledge, O.V. Wright, Aretha Franklin, Lee Moses and Irma Thomas.

Due to often sharing similar influences, moods, southern soul backing and lyrical fare, some deep soul artists forayed into Country Soul.
