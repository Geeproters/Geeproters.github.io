One more vaporwave band in this series, just because I like their music and haven't talked about them in the past.

death's dynamic shroud.wmv or just death's dynamic shroud is an American electronic and vaporwave trio. They're a prolific group, having already released 8 albums just this year, one of which dropped last week,

Here's a track from their 2021 album Faith in Persona

And one track from their 2015 album I'll Try Living Like This

death's dynamic shroud is constantly pushing vaporwave in new directions, reinventing their own sound. I fully recommend these two albums of theirs.
