Samba-canção is a romantic commercial form of Samba that was popular in Brazil in the 1930s—1950s. Invented by composer Henrique Vogeler and literally translating as 'samba song', the style showcases a slower tempo than traditional samba, dropping from around 100 quarter notes per minute to around 80\. The melodic framework is typically more expansive and emotive, with less emphasis placed on the rhythm and percussion. Lyrics usually concern melodramatic tales of love, marriage and tragic romance. Some samba singers in the 1950s took the highly expressive vocal and lyrical emotional heights to an even more dramatic level, leading to the term samba pastoso (or gummy samba).

Developed by songwriters in Rio de Janeiro in the 1920s, the samba-canção soon became a hugely popular song form in the Brazilian music industry, with radio airwaves dominated by popular singers such as Francisco Alves and Orlando Silva singing in the style. Early recordings used sparse arrangements with piano or the cavaquinho guitar and pandeira/tamborim drums, whilst by the 1950s, a more layered, orchestral musical backing was common. During this time, the style also frequently mixed and overlapped with Hispanic American Music genres such as Bolero (sambolero or bolero-canção), Tango and Chachachá.
