Samuel Tear Amidon is an American singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist.

Here's a song from his 2007 album All is Well. The album is a compilation of his contemporary renditions of some classic American folk songs.

This song is a rendition of the traditional folk song, the origin of which may be traced back to Child No. 76 “The Lass of Roch Royal.” In Scottish Ballads by Robert Cambers 1829\. A song of the same name was recorded by Moran Lee "Dock" Boggs' in 1927\.

Very pretty album. He's got a great voice.
