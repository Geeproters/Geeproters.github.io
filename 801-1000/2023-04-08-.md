Bee Thousand is a 1994 Slacker Rock album by Guided by Voices.

Almost every song of this album has a catchy hook. The songs are short and provide a fun variety. I don't mind the lo-fi quality, but it's the creativity that brings me back to certain tracks on the album frequently. I do think it's a bit overhyped, but very enjoyable nonetheless.

The full album, timestamped to my favourite track; Tractor Rape Chain
