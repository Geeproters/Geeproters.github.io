The Swing Revival was a period of renewed interest in the Swing and Jump Blues music styles of the 1930s and 1940s that occurred around the turn of the millennium. It began in the United States during the 1990s with some notable acts being Big Bad Voodoo Daddy and Squirrel Nut Zippers; rather than completely imitating it, however, the scene also incorporated elements from other genres such as Rockabilly, Ska and Punk Rock.

Here are a couple tracks from Squirrel Nut Zippers
