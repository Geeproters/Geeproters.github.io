Traditional black gospel, one of the oldest forms of Gospel, had its beginnings in the late 1920s and in the 1930s when Thomas A. Dorsey, the Blues pianist and composer, began writing songs with Christian lyrics, such as "Peace in the Valley". In addition to the blues, Spirituals were also a strong influence on traditional black gospel. The peak of popularity of the genre was in the 1950s and 1960s. The lead vocalists of groups such as The Soul Stirrers (Sam Cooke and later Johnnie Taylor) and The Pilgrim Travelers (Lou Rawls) went on to success as Soul singers.

Like most gospel music, the stars of traditional black gospel are primarily the singers. This included Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Clara Ward and Mahalia Jackson. Like Southern Gospel, vocal groups were very popular, including The Dixie Hummingbirds, The Swan Silvertones, and The Blind Boys of Alabama. Many of these groups continued with rotating membership into the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, though traditional black gospel has largely given way to contemporary urban gospel in the 21st century. Like black church choirs, instrumentation is often limited to a piano or organ and percussive hand claps, though bass and guitar were increasingly common backing instruments in later years.
