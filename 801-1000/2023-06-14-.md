Powerviolence

Powerviolence is an underground music scene that appeared across California in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Although the genre was not strictly limited to this area, it seems the majority of the most influential artists were rooted there. Powerviolence takes the blueprints of Hardcore Punk and Grindcore (subgenre of extreme Metal and Hardcore \[Punk\] featuring a highly aggressive and chaotic sound characterised by a diverse palette of intense techniques), with the addition of wildly fluctuating tempos within a single song. Often a song may appear to have a similar runtime and brutality as a grindcore track, but then suddenly slow down and develop Sludge Metal-style riffs, and then speed back up into fast grindcore. Powerviolence can often be mistaken as a crossover between grindcore and hardcore punk, as the blastbeats and short song lengths are similar to grindcore, yet the riffs and shouty vocals are more similar to hardcore punk

No Comment's "Downsided" is typically known as landmark song that defines the Powerviolence sound. From 1992
