Son Cubano (appears on recs 694, 525, 524, and 487\) is a style of music from Cuba popular from the 1920s to the 1950s that combines the structures of Spanish song-oriented music along with African rhythms and percussion.

Here's Buena Vista Social Club's eponymous 1997 Son cubano and Bolero album.

Very warm, uplifting, and mellow.

Most of this band's musicians were stars in the Cuban music scene in the 1940s, 50s and 60s, and became somewhat forgotten in the shuffle of politics and whatnot. Guitarist Ry Cooder traveled to Cuba in the 90s with the intent of rediscovering and recording with these legendary musicians.
