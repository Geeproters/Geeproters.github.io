"Wugazi brilliantly combines D.C. legends Fugazi with iconic hip-hop collective Wu-Tang Clan. It is a labor of love by Cecil Otter & Swiss Andy. A yearâ€™s worth of cutting up every imaginable Fugazi record and trying out every Wu-Tang acapella they could get their hands on, resulted in Wugazi: 13 Chambers"

One of my favourite mashup albums. To me, Sleep Rules Everything Around Me, Ghetto Afterthought and Sweet Release all feel like more than the sum of their parts.
