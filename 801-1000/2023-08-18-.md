Jump blues is a style of Blues that emerged in the late 1930s from an important blues orientation of Big Band and Swing, the latter as a grittier version with the addition of the saxophone as one of the main instruments. And performed by artists like Lionel Hampton, Lucky Millinder, Count Basie and their several bands. Jump blues was very popular during 1940s and 1950s through compositions and performances of Louis Jordan, Wynonie Harris, T-Bone Walker, Big Joe Turner and Roy Brown.

Characteristics of jump blues are an uptempo, a middle size of musical ensemble between usual blues and big band ones, as well as an emphasis on saxophones and brass instruments. Jump blues became a major precursor musical genre for Rhythm & Blues as well as for Rock & Roll later.
