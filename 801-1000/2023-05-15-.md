Another spoken word work. Signs of Life, a 2023 album by Neil Gaiman and FourPlay String Quartet.

Neil Richard MacKinnon Gaiman is an English author of short fiction, novels, comic books, graphic novels, audio theatre, and a screenwriter. His works include the comic book series The Sandman and the novels Coraline, Stardust, Anansi Boys, American Gods, and The Graveyard Book.

Gaiman, aside from being a writer, is an experienced narrator and voice actor. To me, at least, his speaking rhythms are quite captivating. There are also songs on the album without his narration and those without any voice, which end up being the weakest, but still enjoyable for those who enjoy string quartet music.

The first track, Clock, is one of the strongest off the album, but others including Mobius Strip, The Wreckers, and In Transit and particularly worth a listen if Neil Gaiman's narrating poetry over chamber music is appealing to you.

The lyrics of this track are from Shakespeare’s Sonnet 12\. FourPlay wrote this in an improvisational manner to a metronome at 60bpm, emulating the ticking of a clock. They let the metronome tick, and from that beating of time, created this piece in its entirety, in one improvised run from beginning to end

Here's the album cover which I quite like:

Sonnet 12 is below. Like a few of Shakespeare's other procreation sonnets 1-17, sonnet 12 is a restatement of the idea of using procreation to defeat time.

When I do count the clock that tells the time,  
And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;  
When I behold the violet past prime,  
And sable curls all silver’d o’er with white;  
When lofty trees I see barren of leaves  
Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,  
And summer’s green all girded up in sheaves  
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,  
Then of thy beauty do I question make,  
That thou among the wastes of time must go,  
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake  
And die as fast as they see others grow;  
   And nothing ‘gainst Time’s scythe can make defence  
   Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence
