Neoclassical New Age is a subgenre of New Age music strongly influenced by and sometimes also based upon early music and the Baroque Music or Classical Period.

Popol Vuh â€“ named after a Mayan manuscript \- were a German Krautrock band, founded by Florian Fricke in 1969\. They are known for pioneering Electronic Space music on their earlier records, the spiritual themes of their main body of work, as well as influencing New Age music.

Their 1972 album Hosianna Mantra is an interesting Neoclassical New Age work, with some Krautrock elements.
