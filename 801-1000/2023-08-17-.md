Swing is a form of Jazz that began in the 1920s, with its prime era between 1935-1945, and was one of the most popular styles of American music until shortly after World War II. Compared to other jazz styles, swing relies on a larger backing rhythm section, comprised of drums, guitar, bass (stand-up or electric), piano or organ, and sometimes a tuba, in varying groupings. This lays the groundwork for the 'lead' section, usually including brass (e.g. trombone, trumpet) and woodwinds (e.g. saxophone, clarinet). Creative and intricate soloing takes the fore on the bandleader's instrument of choice, giving each song its particular character. Swing is an up-tempo music that is highly danceable, its most famous dance perhaps being the jitterbug. There was a brief but powerful Swing Revival during the late 1990s, and its well-known original artists such as Louis Armstrong, Tommy Dorsey, and Count Basie remain popular to this day among jazz enthusiasts.
