I'm not sure if this is still being updated, but this site has the whole released One Piece OST as it corresponds to each episode up to episode 1007\. Its pretty helpful, and if I decide to continue watching instead of reading I'm sure it'll end up saving me a lot of time.

I'll also use this rec for my personal top 3 non-opening tracks  
[One Piece   The worlds number one Oden store](https://youtu.be/g1OFUoK_QrA) (the track that feels the most like One Piece to  me)  
[One Piece OST \- Mezase One Piece part 2](https://youtu.be/zcCZY1Fpd9U) (Drum Island arc is just one of my favorites)  
[One Piece \- Nami's Theme](https://youtu.be/GpBhJo3Jwk8) (the nostalgia is real)  
To The Grand Line, Mother Sea, Village Harbour, Going Merry Ship, Fly and The Puzzling Mouth is Opened are all up there too.

Maybe its partly due to the memories I associate with the show now, but for me OP's OST has always been great at stirring up those feelings of wonder and adventure that the story is all about. Although those feelings can diminish as we age, the feelings the music gives me are a nice reminder that the world is still full of the beautiful and unfamiliar, if we seek it :Apoochin:

It's in a similar realm as a lot of Super Mario Galaxy / Nintendo music for me
