Emerging in the 19th century, baião is a dance rhythm from northeastern Brazil derived from lundu, an Afro-Brazilian style of dance and music. Only in the 1940s did it gain status and popularity through the famous composer and accordion player Luiz Gonzaga, who was considered to be the reinventor and king of baião. In addition to its African origins, the genre contains influences from native tribal dances and Sertanejo de raiz.

Baião is commonly performed with accordions and violas caipiras, and often accompanied by agogô and triangle. More recently, orchestras also became part of the performance. The lyrics contain themes about daily life in northeastern Brazil, its troubles and difficulties. The instrumental form of baião (known as 'baião instrumental') was conceived by Waldir Azevedo, who was responsible for the worldwide spread of the genre.
