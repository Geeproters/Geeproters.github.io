Brega calypso originated in the Brazilian state of Pará in the mid-1990s as a lighter, fresher and poppier approach to Brega music, fusing it with Calypso, Ska and regional music from the state such as Lambada, Carimbó, siriá and guitarrada.

While maintaining the overly romantic vocals and lyrical content from brega, it features bubbly and sensual melodies and rhythms, horn sections and lush Caribbean-like guitar riffs over faster tempos. Artists such as Wanderley Andrade, Banda Sayonara and Edilson Morenno were pioneers to the genre that was developed outside of the molds of the phonographic industry, as releases were distributed directly through street vendors that usually sold only pirate copies.

The genre peaked in the 2000s and became a national sensation, with Banda Calypso as the main diffuser of the rhythm.
