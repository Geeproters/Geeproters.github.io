Grouper is the solo project of American musician, artist and producer Liz Harris. Her music is a mix of Ambient, Drone, Singer-Songwriter, Ambient Pop, Psychedelic Folk, and Dream Pop.

A I A: Alien Observer is the seventh studio album by American musician Liz Harris under the stage name Grouper. It is the second of her two-part album series A I A, preceded by A I A: Dream Loss. On RYM, it's ranked \#1 for 2011, \#556 overall.

I suspect this album will be love-it or hate-it for a lot of people. I need to be in the right mindset to enjoy it.

Extremely atmospheric. An insane amount of reverb creates a dense wall of sound, but musically it's pretty sparse. People seem to associate the sound with isolation, cold and nocturnal imagery
