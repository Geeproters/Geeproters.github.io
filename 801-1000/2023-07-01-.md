Pop Punk

Pop punk is a genre that blends the loud, fast-paced and sometimes sloppy sound of Punk Rock with the catchy sound of Pop music. Pop punk has existed since the inception of punk rock and has thus covered a lot of sonic and lyrical ground, so is often hard to define. For instance, many pop punk bands embrace a fun, light-hearted image, where as others adopt the opposite, an overly melancholic and serious sound.

The earliest pop punk band is often considered to be Ramones. Other bands from the 1970s to embrace a more pop-influenced sound include Buzzcocks and The Undertones. Pop punk became more of a defined sound in the 1980s with the growing Melodic Hardcore and Skate Punk sounds. Bands from this era include Screeching Weasel and The Queers. Pop punk began to break through into the mainstream in the 1990s with bands such as Green Day, Blink-182, and The Offspring. In the mid 2000s the mainstream success of pop punk began to wane and was eventually subsumed by the rising popularity of Emo-Pop. In the 2010s, bands like The Wonder Years and Joyce Manor ushered in a new wave of pop punk with Emo influences.
