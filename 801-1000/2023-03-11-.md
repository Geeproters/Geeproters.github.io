Fugazi is an American post-hardcore band that formed in Washington, D.C., in 1986\. They are known for their style-transcending music, DIY ethical stance, manner of business practice, and contempt for the music industry. Highly influential on punk and alternative music. The band has been on an indefinite hiatus since 2003\.

Some of my favorites:  
[Waiting Room](https://youtu.be/C3LXkdpHNOQ) (1989)  
[Argument](https://youtu.be/gJ5tgQFbBrk) (2001)  
[Afterthought](https://youtu.be/p5Wl9RbbnOU) (1999)

MacKaye chose the word "fugazi" from Mark Baker's Nam, a compilation of stories of Vietnam War veterans, in there being a slang acronym for "Fucked Up, Got Ambushed, Zipped In \[into a body bag\]".
