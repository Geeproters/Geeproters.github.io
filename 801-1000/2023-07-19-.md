Post-Internet

Post-Internet is a 21st-century art movement involving works that are derived from the Internet or its effects on aesthetics, culture and society. A common take on the movement focuses on the feelings or memories evoked by corners of the internet once frequented but now left to decay: Geocities, Angelfire, or any number of poorly coded Chinese websites.

This is very similar to the idea of vaporwave in some regards, but post-internet vaporwave focuses more on the negative or unsettling side of nostalgia.

This subgenre contains releases that offer aesthetic heavy sampling of sounds and music(ak) that are, in essence, a celebration of Internet culture. Post-internet as a term exists beyond vaporwave but also functions within the genre.

I've listened to a number of post-internet albums and I don't usually get those feelings described above. Regardless, here's an album generally considered post-internet to the core, 骷 \[Skeleton\]'s 2010 album Holograms

Also, here's Shader, a 2012 post-internet album from Sacred Tapestry, another Vektroid Alias. Maybe this gives me more of that unsettling feeling?
