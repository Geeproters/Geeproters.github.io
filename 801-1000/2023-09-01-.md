Jazzstep is a genre that combines the rhythm and speed of Drum and Bass with the melodies, composition, and instrumentation of Jazz. Brass instruments, double bass and jazz drumming are sampled and jazz scales are used in conjunction fairly often with vocals, particularly female vocals. Alex Reece popularised the genre in the mid 1990s with his single, "Pulp Fiction / Chill Pill". However, the genre declined in popularity and very few releases came out by the time the 2000s started. It's been superseded by Atmospheric Drum and Bass and Liquid Drum and Bass. Representative artists include Alex Reece and Roni Size & Reprazent.
