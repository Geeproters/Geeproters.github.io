Segahaze

Segahaze is an informal subgenre of vaporwave at least partly rooted in Eccojams: Vol. 1 because of the invocation of the video game aesthetic. Similarly, segahaze invokes sound and imagery associated with early 90s video games (for example, games found on the Sega Genesis and Saturn). Like most vaporwave subgenres, this aesthetic has significant overlap but there have been a number of artists and releases that fall distinctly within this realm.

Distinct from post-internet vaporwave in that segahaze is not explicitly unsettling and not as screwed as eccojams. Segahaze bears a more ambient quality.

Here's an album by Laserdisc Visions a Vektroid alias (See Mallsoft (rec 571)), New Dreams Ltd. from 2011\.

Laserdisc Visions is almost exclusively gaming sounds. The album art also invokes the segahaze aesthetic, at a time when the idea of vaporwave had yet to be termed and subsequently blown up. This release is often regarded alongside Floral Shoppe as being an essential vaporwave release but it also stands definitively as a segahaze venture.
