SCARING THE HOES, by JPEGMAFIA & Danny Brown. Dropped today.  
[JPEGMAFIA x Danny Brown \- SCARING THE HOES VOL. 1 (FULL ALBUM)](https://youtu.be/F2UY_y6IKQE)  
Experimental/Hardcore/Industrial Hip Hop. Incorporates Glitch, Jazz, D\&B, etc.

There's too much to say about this album for a single rec

Every track has at least one really interesting thing. Feeling like it's gonna be my album of the year. Can't pick any least favourite tracks because they're all crazy. Don't judge it from the first song because they're all different.

favourite tracks:  
Orange Juice Jones \- first Peggy invents vaporwave and now he proves he does it best  
HOE \- kinda Donda-esque  
Jack Harlow Combo Meal \- I mainly like it because it has a chopped amen break lol. The piano also hits you like whiplash when you're listening through  
Garbage Pale Kids \- heartwrenching guitar solo parts that could probably make me tear up in the right mood  
Steppa Pig's beat is insane too but that's true for every song here

This is the type of album I listen to too loudly just to hear all the elements
