Raga rock is a style of Psychedelic Rock influenced by South Asian Music, particularly music from India. Sitars and tablas are often used in addition to standard Rock instrumentation.

Indian influences in western popular music were most prevalent in the 1960s, and most raga rock recordings originate from that decade, although there are examples of Indian-derived sounds in post-1960s rock and pop music.

Here's The Orient Express's self-titled raga rock album, released 1969\. Raga rock came in many forms, but this album is pretty indicative of the sound of a lot of the raga rock from that era.
