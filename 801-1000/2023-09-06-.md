Adam Drucker, better known by his stage name Doseone, is an American rapper, producer, poet and artist. He is a co-founder of the indie hip hop record label Anticon. I've been listening to him for several years after discovering that he was the one behind the Enter the Gungeon soundtrack. His music and the music of those he works with generally leans towards abstract and experimental hip-hop.

Here are a couple tracks from two of his collaboration albums:

From Boom Bip & Dose One's 2000 album Circle  
 [Boom Bip & Doseone \- The Birdcatcher's Return](https://youtu.be/2A88_E_cJOA) 

From Deep Puddle Dynamics's The Taste of Rain...Why Kneel?. This group is made up of Alias, Doseone, Sole, and Slug  
[The Scarecrow Speaks](https://youtu.be/K7P0ZeLCYi0)

Among his solo works, The Deadener is one of my favourite tracks of his.

His work is generally pretty divisive, but there's undoubtedly a lot to unpack or dissect, which I think makes for an engaging listen.
